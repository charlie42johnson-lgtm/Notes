# Encoding Grammar in language

**"all languages use the same four fundamental strategies"** (Mair)

1. Inflection
2. Free grammatical morphemes (function words)
3. Word order
4. Intonation
--> a matter of relative prominence

## Inflection
### inflectional morphology:
![[image-9.png]]
- in the course of its history english has shed most of its inflectional endings

## Function words
- use of free grammatical morphemes (prepositions, auxiliaries, pronouns, etc.) to encode gramm info
	- e.g. 
		English: **we will** have
		vs.
		Spanish: **tendremos**

## Word order:

- in modern eng word order is one of most important ways of coding gramm relations in a sentence
--> changes in the order of constituents often lead to changes in meaning or to **ungrammaticality**:

| Jim ate the hamburger.    | * The hamburger ate Jim.  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Jim aß den Hamburger.** | **Den Hamburger aß Jim.** |

## Intonation and tone:
- prosodic features of pitch variation as encoding gramm function (as opposed to pragmatic, attitudinal, discourse and other aspects)
- Particularly important in tonal languages:
	- e.g. Bantu languages: gramm info, such as past vs present, I vs you conveyed solely by tone
- BUT: also relevant in english:
	- He is a student. -- He is a student?
	- My uncle(,) who lives in London(,) got married last week.

# Morphological language types

![[image-11.png]]

## Isolating:
- word structure simple; no bound forms
- one word form per lexeme
- Examples:
	- Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai

NOT NEED TO REMEMBER,  ONLY TO HELP VISUALISE
Mandarin Chinese deeper look: "Gŏu bú xĭhuān chī qīngcài" = ‘Dogs don’t like to eat vegetables’

| gŏu     | bú      | xĭhuān   | chī     | qīngcài       |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------------- |
| **dog** | **not** | **like** | **eat** | **vegetable** |

## Agglutinating:
- word structure complex; one morpheme has one meaning only
- Examples:
	- Turkish, Swahili

NOT NEED TO REMEMBER,  ONLY TO HELP VISUALISE
Turkish deeper look: ‘gelemeyeceğim’ = I will not be able to come.

| gel      | e           | mey          | eceğ       | im             |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| **come** | **be-able** | **Negative** | **Future** | **1st Person** |

## Inflectional:
- word structure complex;
- portmanteau morphemes: a single morpheme can take (or encode) several meanings
- stem alternations: no clear segmentation into morphemes possible
- Examples:
	- French, Latin, German

NOT NEED TO REMEMBER,  ONLY TO HELP VISUALISE
French deeper look: ‘réalisait’ = realised

| réal     | is       | ait                    |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| **real** | **Verb** | **3rd Pers. Sg. Past** |

## Polysynthetic:
- polysynthetic langs at extreme end of the continuum --> several morphemes per word
- elements that are often occur as separate words in other langs (such as arguments of the verb) are expressed morphologically
- Example:
	- Western Greenlandic (polysynthetic **and** agglutinating)

NOT NEED TO REMEMBER,  ONLY TO HELP VISUALISE
Western Greenlandic deeper look:
‘Aliikusersuillammassuaanerartassagaluarpaalli’ 
= However, they will say that he is a great entertainer, but ...

| aliiku        | sersu   | i         | llammas     | sua | a        | nerar | ta  | ssa      | galuar            | paal | li  |
| ------------- | ------- | --------- | ----------- | --- | -------- | ----- | --- | -------- | ----------------- | ---- | --- |
| **entertainment** | **provide** | **SEMITRANS** | **one.good.at** | **COP** | **say.that** | **REP**   | **FUT** | **sure.but** | **3.PL.SUBJ/3SG.OBJ** | **but**  |     |

## What morphological type is English?
- most langs cannot be classified neatly as belonging to exactly one morphological type!

| Inflectional                                  | Agglutinating                              | Isolating                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Portmanteau morphemes                         | complex word  structure                    | one morpheme per word                      |
| no clear segmentation into morphemes possible | one meaning per morpheme                   | word order defines grammatical role        |
| The geese ran<br>She sings                    | unhappiness<br>antidiestablishmentarianism | the cat bit the dog<br>the dog bit the cat |
### -->Long-term development: From inflectional to isolating -->
- Eng displays morphological properties from diff types
- overall has more similarities to isolating langs like Chinese Mandarin than to Latin or Greek

# Word classes / parts of speech

### Word class:
a group of words which, from gramm pov, behave in the same way

- **Morphological similarities:** same inflections
- **Syntactic similarities:** same positions within a sentence
- **Semantic similarities:** similar types of meanings, e.g. name of a person, place or thing

### Commonly distinguished word classes:

- ### Open / lexical word classes:
	- nouns
	- verbs
	- adjectives
	- adverbs
- ### Closed / grammatical / functional word classes:
	- determiners (including articles)
	- pronouns
	- auxiliaries
	- prepositions, conjunctions

# Word classes: Problems

#### Word classes are abstractions:

not all words fall neatly into a single word class
- under as a preposition and adverb
- need as main verb and modal verb
	- This ***does not need to*** be the case.
	- This ***need not*** be the case.

not all words  of a word class share all properties
- non-count nouns do not inflect for number
- modal verbs do not inflect for tense
- some adverbs do not take modifiers
	- * very only

not everyone draws the boundaries between word classes in the same way
- my, their: pronoun or determiner?

- **Articles:** a, the
- **Determiners:** include other forms that can occur in the position of articles:
	- Possessive determiners: my house, their cake
	- Demonstrative determiners: this house, those cakes
	- Quantifiers: many houses, any cakes

# Constituency

#### From word to sentence:
![[image-12.png]]


---

# Testing for constituency

- constituents are chunks of linguistic material that behave together and are part of one functional unit in the larger syntactic context
- BUT: not always discernable in straightforward way where the boundaries are

-->Diagnostics (tests) available for checking whether chunk has constituent status and where its begins and ends

## Motivation:
Understanding the internal structure of phrases, clauses and sentences:
- Which elements are connected to each other more closely?
- Which elements form a structural unit?

## The five tests:
1. Substitution
2. Deletion
3. Movement
4. Coordination
5. Questioning
Note: Not every test works for every constituent!

---
# 1. Substitution
Many constituents can be substituted with pro-forms:
- pronouns for NP
- do so/that for VP
- then, there, that way for adverbials
![[image-13.png|414x253]]
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"></mark>
# 2. Deletion
Some constituents can be deleted without creating ungrammatical sentences
![[image-14.png|420x272]]

# 3. Movement
Some constituents can be moved to a different place in the sentence without creating ungrammatical sentences
![[image-15.png|433x150]]
<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"></mark><mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"></mark>
# 4. Coordination
Some constituents can be coordinated with a constituent of the same type (see below for coordination)
![[image-16.png|436x318]]<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"></mark>

# 5. Questioning
Some constituents can be tested by forming questions about them
![[image-17.png]]


# Visualising constituency: Tree structures

![[image-18.png]]
### Each node / sub-tree = a constituent
