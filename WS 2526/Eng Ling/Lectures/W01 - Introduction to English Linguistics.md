# What is English Linguistics?

### Definition
**Linguistics** is the academic study of the English language It involves analyzing:
- **Language structure** (phonetics and phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics)
- **Language use** (pragmatics, sociolinguistics)
- **Language change** (historical linguistics, politics of language)
- **Language acquisition** (child lang. acquisition, second/foreign lang. acquisition)

### Core Areas of Linguistics

| Area | Focus | Example Questions |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Phonetics** | Physical sounds of speech | How is /p/ pronounced differently in 'pat' vs. 'spat'? |
| **Phonology** | Sound systems and patterns | Why do English speakers aspirate initial /p/ but not after /s/? |
| **Morphology** | Word formation | How do we form 'unhappiness' from 'happy'? |
| **Syntax** | Sentence structure | What makes "The cat sat on the mat" grammatical? |
| **Semantics** | Meaning | What does 'bachelor' mean? |
| **Pragmatics** | Language use in context | Why does "Can you pass the salt?" function as a request? |

# Linguistic Schools:

### More Formal approaches:
- lang. as complex cognitive system (abstract knowledge and potential)
- lang. acquisition as innate and universal
- **focus on** competence (langue) instead of performance (parole)

### More functional approaches:
- lang. as tool for comm. meaning and for social interaction
- **focus on** motivations of particular lang. choices in certain contexts --> parole over time shapes the langue

# Approaches to linguistics:

across diff. schools of thought (formalism - functionalism) there are recurrent distinctions or dichotomies:

## Synchronic vs. Diachronic

### Synchronic approaches:
- describing and analysing lang. at **one specific point in time** 
- often the "here and now", but not necessarily
- looking at specific points in time --> like looking at one ring on tree
### Diachronic approaches:
- describing and analysing lang. over **a period of time**
- often, long ad historically distant periods, but not necessarily
- looking at change over time --> like whole tree


## Prescriptive vs. Descriptive:

### Prescriptive approaches:
- Prescribing how lang. *should* be used
- the "proper" "correct" ways vs. "disprefered" ways
### Descriptive approaches:
- describing how lang. *is really* used
--> linguists usually operate in descriptive framework 


## Language-specific vs. comparative:

### Language-specific approaches:
- focus on individual language (e.g. English linguistics)
### Comparative approaches:
- comparison of two or more languages
	- lang. typology
	- search for universals
	- lang fam trees
	- multilingualism
	- lang diversity


## Empirical vs. introspective:

### Empirical approaches:
- empirical studies: research based on authentic lang data (most modern linguistics transformed into this) 
- gathering data, analysing data; examples: linguistic corpora; ethnographic fieldwork; discourse analysis
### Introspective approaches:
- introspection: relying on intuition
- important starting point for linguistic theorising and questioning

# The nature of dichotomies:
- often understood as binary and mutually exclusive
- BUT: hardly ever occur in "pure" form --> most cases fall on a spectrum
- Dichotomies are **idealisations**
