# What is Morphology?

### Definition
**Morphology** is the study of the  structure of words. 
From Greek *morphē* = "form, shape" + *-logy* = "study of"


---

# What is a word?

## Types and tokens:

Types: distinct items
Tokens: instances of these items
--> NOT equivalent to lexemes/words, distinction on a more abstract level 
### Types or tokens?

There are at least 500,000 words in the English language. 
- notion of types, words don't repeat

The length of your term paper should be 4,500 words.
- notion of tokens, words repeat

## Lexeme: 
- a countable lexical item
- corresponds to entries you find in a dictionary
- separate entries for different parts of speech  (= word classes)
- separate entries for words that are not etymologically related (can (noun) vs. can (verb))

## Word form:
- inflected form of a lexeme
- read --> read(s) = new word form, not new lexeme

## Summing up:
- "word" not a precisely defined linguistic term 
- Instead we use:
	- Lexeme (lexical entities)
	- word form (inflected forms of lexemes)
- terms **type** and **tokens** help clarify whether we talk about distinct forms or number of instances (irrespective of whether we look at words or other structural elements)

# Types of Morphemes: 

### Morpheme:
A **morpheme** is the smallest meaning bearing unit of a language
- are abstractions (on level of langue)

### Morph:
A morph is the form that realises the morpheme 
- are concrete realisations, subject to variation (on level of parole)


### 1. Free Morphemes
- **Definition**: Can stand on their own
- can be lexical or grammatical (=function words)
- **Examples**: 
  - Lexical: book, walk, happy, red...
  - Grammatical: of, to and...
- BUT: distinction between lexical and gram. words not clear cut

### 2. Bound Morphemes
- **Definition**: need to be attached to a base
- can be lexical or grammatical
	- Lexical: derivational morphemes, create new words
	- Grammatical: inflectional morphemes, create new for forms of lexeme
- Can be prefixes or suffixes:
	-  Prefix: added before the base (only deriv. morphemes), 
		- e.g. de-, re-, in-
	- Suffix: added after the base
		- Derivational: -ment, -ise, -ly
		- Inflectional: -s, -ed

### Affixes: Beyond pre- and -suffixes

#### Infix:
- introduced within base
- rare in ENg
- Mostly in swear words:
	- -fucking- : abso**fucking**lutely

#### Circumfix:
- adds an element before and after base
- not used in Eng
- found in Ger: ge-...-t, sagen --> **ge**sag**t

## Inflectional Morphemes: closed class

| Morpheme | Function                         | Example        |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **-s**   | 3rd person singular present      | walk → walks   |
| **-ed**  | Past tense                       | walk → walked  |
| **-ed**  | Past participle                  | walk → walked  |
| **-ing** | Present participle/gerund        | walk → walking |
| **-s**   | Plural (nouns)                   | book → books   |
| **-'s**  | Possessive                       | John → John's  |
| **-er**  | Comparative (adjectives/adverbs) | tall → taller  |
| **-est** | Superlative (adjectives/adverbs) | tall → tallest |

**Note**: English has **only 7-9 inflectional morphemes**!
**Also:** -s is a portmanteau morph!

## Portmanteau morphs:

#### Definition:
A morph (form) that realises more than one grammatical meaning at the same time
##### Examples:

- Sabrina work**s** in a cafe.
	*3rd person sg. present tense indicative*
- She proposed that the governor negotiate**∅** with the president.
	*3rd person sg. present tense subjunctive*
- **She** liked *her*.
	*3rd person sg., female, subject case*
	*3rd person sg., female, object case*



## Derivational morphemes: open(-ish) class

##### Definition:
bound morphemes that carry meaning

##### Productivity of derivational morphemes:
productive morphemes can still be used to make new words

Many derivational morphemes have been part of Eng for a very long time:

- -**ness**: (deriv. suffix)
	- kind --> kindness
	- was productive in Old Eng already: godnes = "goodness"
	- Still productive: singalong-ness
- -**un**: (deriv. prefix)
	- kind --> unkind
	- was productive in Old Eng already: unbrad = "not broad"
	- Still productive: uncrackability

**Still**: New deriv. morphemes can appear and existing ones can undergo change 
--> hence: more open than inflections

## Grammatical Words: (free morphemes)

**They** **indicate** **grammatical** **function**:

- **Determiners**: definite, indefinite and zero articles, quantifiers, demonstrative, possessive, interrogative determiners
- **Auxiliaries:** model, aspectual, passive, dummy auxiliaries
- **Pronouns:** personal, interrogative, relative, indefinite
- **Conjunctions**
- **Prepositions**

**Closed class:**
- limited number, hardly any new members
- little productivity, but is possible --> neo-pronouns

## Analysing complex words:

![[Pasted image 20260108145336.png|412x381]]

| root                               | base                                                   | stem                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| word without any affixes (control) | word without inflectional suffixes (uncontrollability) | words to which an affix is added (e.g. controllable is base of uncontrollable) |

##### Variation in the realisation of morphemes:
- control vs. controll
- able vs. abil
- ity vs. itie
--> Allomorphs!


---

# Allomorphs:

- morphemes can be realised by more than one form
- **Allomorphs** = diff. realisations of the same morpheme
- Examples:
	- control, controll
	- -able, -abil
	- -ity, -itie
	- -ing, -in

##### Factors deciding on realisation: 
- Variety, style, dialect (e.g., -ing, -in)
- Surrounding forms and sounds
	- -able is realised as -abil when it is followed by another morpheme that starts with a vowel
		- uncontrollable
		- uncontrollables
		- uncontrollability


## Allomorphs of plural -s:

Plural -s can be realised in three diff. forms:

- /ɪz/: vowel ɪ followed by voiced s, e.g. kisses
- /s/: voicless s, e.g. kits
- /z/: voiced s, e.g. kids
/ɪz/, /s/ and /z/ are all allomorphs of the morpheme -s


## Suppletion: special case of allomorphy

--> entirely diff. realisation, entire root changes

- Used to describe (so-called) irregular forms:
	- mouse - mice
	- bad - worse
	- buy - bought
- Instead of addinf an (inflec.) morpheme to base (root), the root changes
- Common process in Ger:
	- Haus - Häuser
	- gesund - gesünder
	- gehen - ging

# Word Formation Processes

## Some terminology

- **Neologism:** new word
- **Nonce (ad hoc) formations:** "formations which at least the word creator is convinced never to have heard or read before" (Kortmann)
- **Institutionalisation:** neologism is used by other members of lang community = thus stops being a  neologism
- **Productivity:** whether or not a word formation process creates many new words


---

# Lexical innovation and word formation
- not looking at morphological word formation in close sense

## Word formation processes:
![[image-105.png]]
- some word formation processes add more to lang than others

## Semantic shift:

**Existing words acquire new meaning** = taking diff. stuff and instilling diff. semantic meaning
- more concrete to more abstract
- morphological material does not change = semantic does

![[image-106.png]]
- undergone semantic shift due to tech innovation
- comp mouse has similar shape to mouse
- tail structure with cable
- analogies = resemblance

![[image-107.png]]
- due to tech innovation it has evolved
- semantic shift tends to the more abstract and more metaphorical words

## Borrowings from other languages:
![[image-108.png]]
![[image-109.png]]


## Eponymy and adoption of brand names:
-  nym is greek root for name

### Eponyms: Proper names turn into words
- atlas: Atlas (greek mythology)
- champagne: Champagne (region in france)
- sandwich: Sandwich (4th earl of Sandwich)

### Brand names:
- google: to use the google search engine --> named after large number googol (10 to power of 100), coined in 1930s
- xerox: to photocopy --> also a borrowing: xeros = dry in Old greek
- hoover: to use a vacuum cleaner --> also an eponym!

**"The vast majority of new words is thus formed  by modifying existing ones"** (Mair)


---

# Derivation
- can change word meaning or word class
	- word class = noun, adjective, verb, etc.

## Suffixation:
- suffixation tends to change word class
![[image-110.png]]

## Prefixation:

#### Word-class maintaining: = meaning changes but word class stays same
- un-: unkind, uncertain
- dis-: dislike, distrust
- re-: recycle, remove
- post-: post-truth, post-fact (Prazmo 2019)

#### Word-class changing: changes meaning and also word class
- be-: befriend, bedevil, bewitch, behead, belittle
- en-: enjoy, enlist, enslave, enlarge, enrich
	- some productivity: e.g. en-shitification


---

# Compounding
- two free morphemes combined = free morpheme + free morpheme
![[image-111.png]]
- almost any kind of free morpheme can go with any other free morpheme

## Primary stress:
- takes the primary stress of the first syllable

| **Compound**  |                    | **Phrase**   |                    |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------ |
| 'blackbird    | the species        | black 'bird  | just a black bird  |
| 'darkroom<br> | where develop pics | dark 'room   | just a dark room   |
| 'small talk   | chit chat          | small 'talk  | just a small talk  |
| 'short story  | type of story      | short 'story | just a short story |
| 'White House  | where pres lives   | white 'house | just a white house |
#### In addition:
- not separable (* a dark large room)
- no modification of first element (* a very White House)
- not compositional: meaning exceeds meaning of parts (e.g a blackbird is not just any bird that is black)

## Headedness:
- one free morpheme has to supply meaning
	- how the word class is defined

### Head:
- In english: the head is the right element in a compound = **often** **but** **not** **always**
- defines the word class of the compound
- usually defines main meaning of compound:
	- water**bed**: special type of bed
	- head**strong**: special type of strong
	- proof**read**: special type of reading
	- 


---

# Semantic types

## Endocentric compounds: --> most common
- A + B = special kind of B
- water(A)bed(B)

## Exocentric compounds: -->meaning outside the A + B parts
- A + B = something metonymically related to B
- pick(A)pocket(B), skin(A)head(B)

## Appositional compounds: 
- A + B = alternative and complementary descriptions
- singer(A)-songwriter(B)

## Copulative compounds: --> rather rare
- A + B = sum of A + B
- sleep(A)walk(B) --> literally sleeping + walking


---

# Derivation or compounding?

## Derivation:
## free morpheme + derivational affix

#### But less clear from diachronic perspective:
- neighbour-**hood**
- wis-**dom**
- friend-**ly**
- like-**wise**
--> used to be free morphemes in earlier periods of eng
Today: derivational suffixes

## Compounding:
## free morpheme + free morpheme

- disc-**man**, walk-**man**
--> compounds consisting of two free morphemes
morpheme *man* could potentially develop into a derivational suffix


---

# Conversion (zero derivation)

### noun > verb:  
bottle, butter, bicycle, carpet, father, knife, mother, mail, queue, ship, shoulder

### adjective > verb: 
better, calm, dirty, dry, empty, faint, idle, open, pale, right, total, wrong

### verb > noun: 
cough, cover, desire, doubt, guess, love, rise, smell, smile, spy, turn, want

### conjunction > noun: 
**ifs** and **buts** 
### preposition > verb: 
to **up** the prices, to **down** a beer


---

# Shortenings

## Clippings:  
- shortening of a word without changing its word  class or meaning
- literally taking something away
- Examples:
	- exam (< examination), bus (< omnibus), flu (< influenza)

## Blends:
- combining two words into one
- Examples:
	-  brunch (< breakfast + lunch), blog (< web + log), slanguage (< slang + language)

## Acronyms:
- **PRONOUNCED AS A WORD!!!**
- Examples:
	- laser, radar, asap, UNESCO, RAM, ERASMUS

## Alphabetisms / Initialisms:
-  **PRONOUNCED AS LETTERS!!!**
- Examples:
	- TV, DJ, OED, IPA, ADHD

## Back formations:
- looks like opposite of derivation: removing part of word that could be derivational affix
- usually changes meaning and/or word class
- Examples:
	- edit (< editor), donate (< donation), self-destruct (< self-destruction), 
	 babysit (< babysitter)
