# What is Morphology?

### Definition
**Morphology** is the study of the  structure of words. 
From Greek *morphē* = "form, shape" + *-logy* = "study of"

# What is a word?

## Types and tokens:

Types: distinct items
Tokens: instances of these items
--> NOT equivalent to lexemes/words, distinction on a more abstract level 
### Types or tokens?

There are at least 500,000 words in the English language. 
- notion of types, words don't repeat

The length of your term paper should be 4,500 words.
- notion of tokens, words repeat

## Lexeme: 
- a countable lexical item
- corresponds to entries you find in a dictionary
- separate entries for different parts of speech  (= word classes)
- separate entries for words that are not etymologically related (can (noun) vs. can (verb))

## Word form:
- inflected form of a lexeme
- read --> read(s) = new word form, not new lexeme

## Summing up:
- "word" not a precisely defined linguistic term 
- Instead we use:
	- Lexeme (lexical entities)
	- word form (inflected forms of lexemes)
- terms **type** and **tokens** help clarify whether we talk about distinct forms or number of instances (irrespective of whether we look at words or other structural elements)

# Types of Morphemes: 

### Morpheme:
A **morpheme** is the smallest meaning bearing unit of a language
- are abstractions (on level of langue)

### Morph:
A morph is the form that realises the morpheme 
- are concrete realisations, subject to variation (on level of parole)


### 1. Free Morphemes
- **Definition**: Can stand on their own
- can be lexical or grammatical (=function words)
- **Examples**: 
  - Lexical: book, walk, happy, red...
  - Grammatical: of, to and...
- BUT: distinction between lexical and gram. words not clear cut

### 2. Bound Morphemes
- **Definition**: need to be attached to a base
- can be lexical or grammatical
	- Lexical: derivational morphemes, create new words
	- Grammatical: inflectional morphemes, create new for forms of lexeme
- Can be prefixes or suffixes:
	-  Prefix: added before the base (only deriv. morphemes), 
		- e.g. de-, re-, in-
	- Suffix: added after the base
		- Derivational: -ment, -ise, -ly
		- Inflectional: -s, -ed

### Affixes: Beyond pre- and -suffixes

#### Infix:
- introduced within base
- rare in ENg
- Mostly in swear words:
	- -fucking- : abso**fucking**lutely

#### Circumfix:
- adds an element before and after base
- not used in Eng
- found in Ger: ge-...-t, sagen --> **ge**sag**t

## Inflectional Morphemes: closed class

| Morpheme | Function                         | Example        |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **-s**   | 3rd person singular present      | walk → walks   |
| **-ed**  | Past tense                       | walk → walked  |
| **-ed**  | Past participle                  | walk → walked  |
| **-ing** | Present participle/gerund        | walk → walking |
| **-s**   | Plural (nouns)                   | book → books   |
| **-'s**  | Possessive                       | John → John's  |
| **-er**  | Comparative (adjectives/adverbs) | tall → taller  |
| **-est** | Superlative (adjectives/adverbs) | tall → tallest |

**Note**: English has **only 7-9 inflectional morphemes**!
**Also:** -s is a portmanteau morph!

## Portmanteau morphs:

#### Definition:
A morph (form) that realises more than one grammatical meaning at the same time
##### Examples:

- Sabrina work**s** in a cafe.
	*3rd person sg. present tense indicative*
- She proposed that the governor negotiate**∅** with the president.
	*3rd person sg. present tense subjunctive*
- **She** liked *her*.
	*3rd person sg., female, subject case*
	*3rd person sg., female, object case*



## Derivational morphemes: open(-ish) class

##### Definition:
bound morphemes that carry meaning

##### Productivity of derivational morphemes:
productive morphemes can still be used to make new words

Many derivational morphemes have been part of Eng for a very long time:

- -**ness**: (deriv. suffix)
	- kind --> kindness
	- was productive in Old Eng already: godnes = "goodness"
	- Still productive: singalong-ness
- -**un**: (deriv. prefix)
	- kind --> unkind
	- was productive in Old Eng already: unbrad = "not broad"
	- Still productive: uncrackability

**Still**: New deriv. morphemes can appear and existing ones can undergo change 
--> hence: more open than inflections

## Grammatical Words: (free morphemes)

**They** **indicate** **grammatical** **function**:

- **Determiners**: definite, indefinite and zero articles, quantifiers, demonstrative, possessive, interrogative determiners
- **Auxiliaries:** model, aspectual, passive, dummy auxiliaries
- **Pronouns:** personal, interrogative, relative, indefinite
- **Conjunctions**
- **Prepositions**

**Closed class:**
- limited number, hardly any new members
- little productivity, but is possible --> neo-pronouns

## Analysing complex words:

| root                               | base                                                   | stem                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| word without any affixes (control) | word without inflectional suffixes (uncontrollability) | words to which an affix is added (e.g. controllable is base of uncontrollable) |

##### Variation in the realisation of morphemes:
- control vs. controll
- able vs. abil
- ity vs. itie
--> Allomorphs!


---

# Allomorphs:

- morphemes can be realised by more than one form
- **Allomorphs** = diff. realisations of the same morpheme
- Examples:
	- control, controll
	- -able, -abil
	- -ity, -itie
	- -ing, -in

##### Factors deciding on realisation: 
- Variety, style, dialect (e.g., -ing, -in)
- Surrounding forms and sounds
	- -able is realised as -abil when it is followed by another morpheme that starts with a vowel
		- uncontrollable
		- uncontrollables
		- uncontrollability


## Allomorphs of plural -s:

Plural -s can be realised in three diff. forms:

- /ɪz/: vowel ɪ followed by voiced s, e.g. kisses
- /s/: voicless s, e.g. kits
- /z/: voiced s, e.g. kids
/ɪz/, /s/ and /z/ are all allomorphs of the morpheme -s


## Suppletion: special case of allomorphy

--> entirely diff. realisation, entire root changes

- Used to describe (so-called) irregular forms:
	- mouse - mice
	- bad - worse
	- buy - bought
- Instead of addinf an (inflec.) morpheme to base (root), the root changes
- Common process in Ger:
	- Haus - Häuser
	- gesund - gesünder
	- gehen - ging
