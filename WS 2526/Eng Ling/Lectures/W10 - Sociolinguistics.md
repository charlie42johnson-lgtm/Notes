# **Preliminaries: Varieties and Variation**
- language isn't stable
- it varies all the time
- rules can make language look stable
---
# Sociolinguistics: Three branches (Kortmann 2020: 202)

## "Geographic" Sociolinguistics:
- also called **dialectology** --> like an olive branch
- Studies regional varieties --> dialects (= Freiburg vs Kiel)
- oldest branch (since 19th century)
- traditional dialectology has given way to variationist sociolinguistics and modern methods
- **BUT:** regional variation remains important field of study

## Anthropological Sociolinguistics:
- "anthro" = the human --> specifically human cultures
- studies connection between lang, thought and culture
- since 1920s

## "Sociological" Sociolinguistics:
- also called **variationist sociolinguistics** 
- studies structured variation in lang that also includes social factors 
	- (class, age, gender, group affiliation etc.)
- studies regional variation (usually in combo with social factors) in context of dialects or global variets (New Englishes)
- since 1960s --> a more recent development

# Language Variation

It is found on all levels of linguistics:
- Phonetics and phonology: Pronunciation differences
	- RP vs. GA: Rhoticity, /a/ vs. /æ/ before fricatives
- Spelling
	- realisation vs. realization
- Lexicon
	- lorry vs. truck
- Morphology and syntax
	- have got vs. have gotten
- Pragmatics: E.g. politeness differences
	- indirectness vs. involvement

# Types of variation (Kortmann 2020: 204)

![[image-94.png|582x309]]

**Genderlect:** 
- how diff. genders speak
**Dependent on the communicative situation:** 
- variation also depends on this
	- so like how you speak with friends vs. professors
		- performing diff. personas based of situations

# Terminology:

## Variety: Most neutral term
- any identifiable linguistic practice

## Standard:
- non-regional prestige variety
	- prescribed, idealised as the proper way to speak --> e.g. RP

## Regional Varieties:
- (regional) dialect
	- seen as less prestigious, being more informal

## Social Varieties:
- Sociolect: Abstract term to refer to social varieties 
- Genderlect 
- Ethnolect
- Youth language 
- … 
- Jargon

## Situational Varieties:
- Register: Functional variety
	- is a more technical term
	- is a functional variety, not social, more formal
- Slang
- Jargon

## Accent:
- focus on the pronunciation aspects of a given variety (can be regional or social)

# **Traditional dialectology: The study of regional variation**
- regions: geographic spread

# Language vs Dialect

#### How can we distinguish between languages and dialects?

### Common assumption: Mutually intelligible
- dialects of a lang are believed to be mutually intelligible
	- mutually intelligible = diff enough to sound diff, but still similar enough to be understood
- If two speakers  understand each other, thought to speak dialects of  same lang
- **BUT:** is this correct?

### Nowegian, Swedish and Danish:
- mutually intelligible
- BUT generally considered to be different langs

### Chinese dialects (e.g. Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, Hainan, Hakka):
- not mutually intelligible
- BUT considered to be dialewcts of the same lang

### Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian:
- mutually intelligible and used to be labelled under same umbrella term "Serbo-Croation"
- BUT today many people regard them as distinct langs

## Extra-linguistic Factors:

In the classification of langs and dialects, extra-linguistic factors are at least as important (if not more) than linguistic ones
- political
- historical
- socio-psychological
- socio-economic etc.
	- regional pride, national pride

#### "A language is a dialect with an army and a navy"
(Max Weinreich)
- languageness is associated with nation states and political power that comes with it

# Mapping dialects in Great Britain

- North to south cline

# Mapping dialects in North America

![[image-96.png|514x337]]


# Dialect Maps: Isoglosses
- concerned with mapping languages
#### Isogloss:
a line of a map marking the boundary between two regions which differ with respect to a particular linguistic feature (e.g. a lexical item, the pronunciation of a particular word)

- Bundles of isoglosses may indicate **dialect boundaries**
	- one isogloss = one feature

### Examples:
Three isoglosses representing the northern dialect area of the Eastern USA:
- whiffletree, whippletree ‘swingletree’ / ‘singletree’
- pail ‘bucket’
- darning needle ‘dragon fly’

# Data collection: recent methods

![[image-99.png|424x383]]
![[image-100.png]]


## Examples in German:

Task: think about your own language use, in particular in your **vernacular** 
	(vernacular = the informal, local way of speaking where you grew up) 
What is the typical way of referring to 
1. A bread roll? 
![[image-101.png|532x390]]

2. The safe space when playing catch? („sicherer Ort beim Fangenspiel“)
![[image-103.png]]

# Studying regional variation: dialects to global variation

In second half of 20th century, English linguistics developed interest in regional variation on global scale:
- ling variation related to colonial expanse of British Empire
	- = New Englishes / Global Englishes
- uses of English related to global reach of anglophone culture, in particular through the rise of USA to global power in 20th century
	- English as Global Language
	- English as a lingua Franca (ELF)
- more recent perspectives on geographical variation
	- more into global perspective

# Kachru's three circles model

![[image-104.png|451x415]]

# Status of English Varieties

#### Inner Circle:
- English as a native language
- where Eng is the majority L1 of speakers and has been for a long time
#### Outer Circle:
- English used for official purposes
- where eng has some kind of function
- where eng not L1 of majority, but substantial amount of ppl who learn it as a L2
- used in government, etc.
- refers to colonies of former British Empire
#### Expanding Circle:
- English as a foreign language ➔ Fluent boundaries, situation often more complex
- eng used as lingua franca
- cultural = entertainment, business
- used as foreign language
- Germany is a prime example of expanding circle
#### Development of new varieties (e.g. Singapore English):
- Eng in  outer circle can increasingly be used as L1
- Starts to develop its own norms: 
	- “correct” and “wrong” lang use can no longer be judged with respect to original standard variety

# ICE: International Corpus of English
- accessibility of the corpus is not great

- collaborative project including various teams of researchers
- **Aim:** compiling comparable corpora of diff varieties of eng
- Currently available (+ several more in prep)
	- Canada
	- East Africa
	- Great Britain
	- Hong Kong • India
	- Ireland
	- Jamaica
	- New Zealand
	- Sri Lanka
	- Nigeria
	- Uganda
	- The Philippines
	- Singapore
	- USA (written only)
	- Gibraltar (written only)

# **Variationist sociolinguistics: Focus on social variation**
---

# From dialectology to sociolinguistics

- 20th century, dialectology expands into the study of sociolinguistics:
- had been most interested/had idealised in rural places and homogeneous groups of speakers
	- most "unspoiled" language --> vernacular: informal spontaneous ways of speking
- --> focus on „N.O.R.M.S.“: „non-mobile, older, rural male speakers“
	- least likely to pick up new slang => resistant to change
- By contrast, sociolinguists develop an interest in other forms of regional variation, in particular cities and urban areas
- discover that linguistic variaties can be explained through other factors than just regional variation
- --> focus on additional factors that have an influence on linguistic variation: social stratification (e.g. social class, gender, age)
	- concept of hierarchial viewing of categories

# From traditional dialectology to sociolinguistics

# The sociolinguistic variable

- variation built on idea that there are linguistic variables
Basic idea of a linguistic variable:
- A linguistic variable is a set of alternative ways of saying the same thing
	- when we make utterances we have a set of choices of how we utter something
- The alternatives are called variants (variants of one variable)
	- they have social significance --> behind our choices as speakers have social significance
- --> realization of a linguistic variable interacts with extralinguistic independent variables like social class, age, ethnic group or contextual style (they **co-vary**)
	- **co-vary**: they interact together
- --> Different variables have a tendency to co-vary together = **varieties**
	- "A person who realises the linguistic variable "X" in this specific way is statistically likely to pronounce "Y" in this other way."

# Variables and correlations

#### Non-linguistic (extralinguistic) variables: Independent variables:
- Social variables:
	- Region
	- Socio-economic class
	- Ethnicity
	- Gender
	- Age
- BUT also:
	- Style = more formal or less formal

#### Linguistic variables: Dependent variables:
- Any linguistic unit realised by more than one norm
- Examples:
	- (-ing) as in singing: /ɪŋ/ or /ɪn/
	- post-vocalic (r) as in farm or car: /r/ or ∅
	- ‘soft drink’: soda vs. pop
	- possessive: the daughter of my neighbour or my neighbour’s daughter

##### There is a search for correlations between non-linguistic and linguistic variables
#### Assumption: 
Non-linguistic variables influence the realisation of linguistic variables

# Change from above and change from below
- idea of language change deeply connected to linguistic variation
	- where there is linguistic variation the door is opened to linguistic innovation
	- where there is linguistic innovation the door is opened to language change

#### Change from above:
- can be but NOT necessarily the ruling class etc
	- --> !!! MEANS from public awareness
- Introduced by dominant social class / group
- Full public awareness --> conscious choice of the speaker
- Often borrowings with higher prestige

#### Change from below:
- can be but NOT necessarily from lower class
	- !!! MEANS below public awareness
- Introduced by any social class / group (but not observed for highest status group)
- Below the level of social awareness until change is near completion --> subconscious choice of speaker
- First appear in vernacular
- Most language changes are changes from below

# A closer look at variables
- notion of different levels of awareness

- linguistic features  can be realized as different variants depending on the variety that a speaker uses
	- as linguistic variables co-vary with extralinguistic variables, they become socially meaningful
- --> Variables sometimes work as a social diagnostic: 
	- speakers notice (consciously or unconsciously) which features others use and assess their language on that basis

##### However, not all variables are socially „visible“ to the same extent 
- some we notice quickly, but not the case for all
--> Linguistic variables differ in the degree to which they are **percieved as variables** by speakers
##### Labov identified three different degrees of metalinguistic awareness:
- indicator
- marker
- stereotype

![[image-148.png|280x220]]

- The higher on the pyramid the more metalinguistic awareness
- The lower on the pyramid the less metalinguistic awareness
### Indicators:
- show no evidence that speakers are even subconsciously aware of them
- speakers consistently favour one variant over another regardless of who they are talking to or where
- --> are linguistic features which correlate with social stratification or a social group
	- but show no variation across different styles of speaking
	- Speakers do not seem to be aware of such forms and make no overt comment on them
Example:
- phonological variation based on the Northern Cities Shift in the USA
	- e.g. /ɪ/ → /ɛ/ bit → bet

### Markers:
- linguistic features whose usage correlates both with social group and with speech style
	- speakers are (somewhat) aware of such forms and their group associations but do not comment overtly on them
- --> Speakers show some subconscious awareness of markers
	- this is made evident in the fact that they consistently use more of one variant in formal styles of speech and more of another variant in informal styles of speech
Example:
- variation in use of –in’/-ing; postvocalic /r/ in New York City as in labov’s department store study

### Stereotypes:
- linguistic features of varieties that are widely recognized and are very often the subject of (not always strictly accurate!) dialect performances and impersonations
	- Often show sharp social stratification
- --> are features that people can comment on and discuss
	- they often have very strong positive or negative opinions about them
Examples:
- double negation (ain’t got no time)
- pronunciation of the STRUT vowel in English dialects (butter, bus)

# Linguistic prestige and stigma
!!! REMEMBER: sociolinguistics is a fundamental insight of how we and others speak
- how social hierarchies are maintained 
- how power structures are maintained

linguistic variation also functions as a social diagnostic:
- speakers assess other speakers and valorize or devalorize others based on the kinds of variation they use
	- distinction between sociolinguistic **stigma** (devalorization) and **prestige** (valorization)

### Prestige:
- Linguistic features and varieties which are seen as socially desirable are valorized
	-  become associated with high status and endowed with prestige
Prestige can be overt or covert:
- **Overt prestige:** 
	- standard usually has overt prestige
		- generally socially acknowledged as ‘correct’ and therefore valued highly among all speakers of the language
- **Covert prestige:**
	- Non-standard varieties often said to have covert prestige ascribed to them by their speakers
	- A specific, small group of speakers shows positive evaluation of and orientation towards a certain linguistic variety
		- usually without the speakers' awareness
	- The variety usually not accepted in all social groups (e.g. youth language)

### Stigma:
- Features and varieties which are low in prestige become devalorized and associated with low status
	- carry sociolinguistic stigma
- --> Stereotypes often involved in the social construction of linguistic stigma, e.g:
	- linguistic parodies and impersonations
	- media discourse
	- language curricula in schools and universities
- --> Linguistic stigma can lead to massive linguistic discrimination and is almost always linked to practices of social inequality 
	- Examples: 
		- the stigmatization of vocal fry („creaky voice“) in young female speakers
		- linguistic discrimination against speakers of African American English

# Three waves of variationist studies
- time base differentiation

#### First wave variation studies: 
primary focus on the correlation of dependent and independent variables
- basic construct of variable
#### Second wave variation studies: 
built on the first wave to include ethnographic information about social factors and speaker agency
- becomes more small scale
- notion of social networks: identity
#### Third wave variation studies: 
shift from looking at how language reflects membership in particular social categories to how language is used to construct social identities
- small scale takes centre stage
- through linguistic studies identity becomes constructed
	- e.g. gender, etc...

## First wave: Labov’s fourth floor study:

#### William Labov:
- Linguist, 1927–2024
- One of founders of variationist sociolinguistics
- Carried out many influential studies, one of which was his fourth floor study

#### Fourth floor study:
Research question: How does the pronunciation of post-vocalic /r/ vary across different speakers in New York City? --> question situated in NYC

Background:
- General American Standard English: Rhotic (/r/ pronounced)
	- New York City: became r-less in the 19th century
	- Re-introduction of r pronunciation after World War II as a “change from above”
- Assumed variation according to:
	- Social class
	- Style (formality, attention)
	- Position (word-medial vs. word-final)

### Methodology:

Interviewer asking for directions to a department known to be located on the fourth floor
	- fourth floor: Two instances of post-vocalic /r/, one word-medial and one word-final
Interviewer pretends not to have understood answer: “Excuse me?” ➜ Repetition of answer
	- Second answer can be expected to be spoken in more careful style
Recording of response:
- Handwritten note
- **Independent variables:** 
	- Store and social information about respondent
- **Dependent variable:** 
	- Pronunciation of /r/ in all four positions

### Conclusions and additional research:

- Pronunciation of /r/ is influenced by
	- Social class 
	- Style
	- Linguistic constraints (e.g. position)
- Variation as a matter of frequency

## Second wave: Milroy (and Milroy’s) social networks studies:
Leslie (b. 1944) (and James Milroy (1933–2017))

- idea that we are part of a social network

- Research on non-standard English in working-class Belfast, Northern Ireland
- Demonstrated emergence of “vernacular norms”
	- symbolising solidarity and reciprocity
	- Examples of covert prestige features
		- how people do a working class identity
		- certain ways of practicing sociolinguistic variation is a way of indexing
			- part of a network

### Method:
- Participant observation: 
	- Participating in the community 
		- quantitative ethnowork
- Network analysis: Dense and multiplex networks
- Eight phonetic variables
	- how phonetic variables play out in a network

### Overall finding:
- The stronger the network, the more frequent the nonstandard features
- Social networks develop their own linguistic norms
- The more an individual is integrated into a social network the more they will adhere to the network’s linguistic norms

### High-density, low-density, and multiplex networks:

#### Low-density network:
![[image-149.png|183x165]]
Individuals who know the central member don’t know each other

#### High-density network:
![[image-150.png|204x180]]
Every member of the network knows all the other members
- Milroy focused on this

#### Multiplex links:
![[image-151.png]]
Members are linked through several co-existing types of ties, e.g. family relations, friendship, workplace, etc.

## Members are linked through several co-existing types of ties, e.g. family relations, friendship, workplace, etc.

## Community of practice:
- local adhoc practices, small scale ethnographic approach
	-  not big boxes like MALE or FEMALE

“A community of practice is an aggregate of people who come together around mutual engagement in an endeavor. Ways of doing things, ways of talking, beliefs, values, power relations – in short, practices – emerge in the course of this mutual endeavor. As a social construct, a community of practice is different from the traditional community, primarily because it is defined simultaneously by its membership and by the practice in which that membership engages.” 
(Eckert and McConnell-Ginet 1992: 464)

![[image-152.png|430x309]]

### Example: Code-switching and ethnic identity:

Study by De Fina (2007):
- ##### Topic: 
	- Construction of Italian ethnicity in an all-male card playing club in the United States

 - ##### Community of Practice: 
	 - Card players regularly participating in club
		- Joint enterprise: Card playing, contributing to the club
		- Mutual engagement: Regular interactions in the club
		- Linguistic repertoire: Card-playing terminology, code-switching into Italian

- ##### Method: 
- Ethnographic study at “Il Circolo della Briscola” in Washington area
	- Observation
	- Taking notes
	- Interviews of members
	- Video and audio recordings of games and interactions 
	
- ##### Selected results: 
	- Codeswitching is used as a linguistic strategy of constructing Italian ethnicity
	- Use of Italian is enforced in the domain of the game:
		- Ability to speak (some) Italian is part of being a good card player
