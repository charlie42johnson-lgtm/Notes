# Diachronic and synchronic linguistics

## Diachronic = across time
- almost synonymous with looking at lang from long ago
- diachronic ling studies lang change across diff periods
- often associated with historical periods
- **BUT:** diachronic studies of ongoing lang change are equally possible
	- lang change is always ongoing

## Synchronic = within time / at one time point
- looking at here and now
- synchronic ling studies lang within a given period
- often associated with the study of present-day lang use
- **BUT:** synchronic studies of earlier periods are equally possible 
	- t a specific time (historical)
	- e.g. studying middle english, a given dialect of middle english, etc.

### The study of historical linguistics covers all structural levels!

# Why does language change?

- languages do not stay put
- it is inevitable and crucial
- has to do with the users of the lang
#### Language change = language users (the speakers) change the way in which they use language!
—> can be rapid, often goes unnoticed

## Factors that can explain lang change:

### Simplification: Ease of use:
- slæpde (early old eng) —> slæpte (later old eng)
	"slept": assimilation —> phonological change here

### Simplification: Regularisation:
- irregular forms of paradigms become regularized
- cows instead of knie (but: oxen, children)
- swelled instead of swollen (but: sung, gone)

### Complexification: Increasing precision:
- new second person plural forms *you guys, yall, youse*
- lexical or semantic gaps for expressing —> users come up with new

### Language policies and ideologies:
- prescriptivism (e.g. spelling and punctuation)
- avoidance of *thou* (2nd pers. pro.) due to association of use of form with Quakers

### Language contact:
- Borrowings —> when lang and varieties come into contact they influence each other

### New concepts / use of language:
- creation of new vocabulary, e.g. *to tweet, to google*
—> sociocultural change and technological advancements

# Periodisation

## Periods of English:

### Old English: 450-1100/1150
- Beowulf (c. 1000)
### Middle English: 1100/1150-1500
- Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (c. 1400)
### Early Modern English: 1500-1700
- Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1595)
- Aphra Behn's Oroonoko (1688)
### Late Modern English: 1700-1900?
- Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818)
- Jane Austen's Emma (1815)
### Present-day English: Since 1900? 2000?
- Julien Barnes The Sense of an Ending (2011)
- Bernardine Evaristo Girl, Woman, Other (2019)

#### Important because literature represents lang use
—> increased over periods

- The works from OE, ME and EME are crucial as we do not have access to spontaneous spoken discourse from this time so these are the only recordings of lang use from these periods
- these are the only source we have for study as these are the texts that have survived

---

# Language internal and external factors
—> Language change is always gradual —> periodisation is a simplification
—> there can be change at any level

## Differentiates stage of language that differ in:

### Phonology:
- sound changes
- differences in phonological inventory
### Vocabulary:
- lexicon
- semantic meaning of words
### Morphology:
- inflections
- derivations
### Syntax:
- word order
### Pragmatics:
- lang conventions (e.g. politeness)


## Selection of period boundaries:

- often based on historical events with a (more or less) impact on lang
- early 5th century: withdrawal of Romans, arrival of Germanic tribes in Britain --> beginning of Old English
- 1066: Norman Conquest
- 1476: Caxton's printing press --> impact on lang and ling = book culture
- 1492: Christopher Columbus' voyage across the Atlantic Ocean
- 1755: Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English language --> standartisation of the eng lang
- 1906: first radio broadcast
- 1989: world wide web --> as communicative tech

## Example:

### The Adoration of the Magi (Bible, Mt 2:9-12)
- great for comparative studies —> is a fundamental text

# **Old English: 450-1100/1150**
---

# Before Old English:

- Before 43AD: Britons (predom celtic)
	- North: Picts and Scots
- 55 and 54 BC: Attacks by Julius Caesar (unsuccessful)
- 43AD: Roman conquest by Claudius
- 367 AD: Attack of Roman Britain
	- by Picts and Scots from North
	- by Saxon tribes from east
- 410 AD: withdrawal of Roman troops
- Throughout 5th century: attacks by Germanic tribes (Angles, Saxons and Jutes) =colonisation of Brit isles by Germ tribes
	- Origins of Old English

# Old English: Some characteristics:

## Grammar:
- Inflectional lang
	- full inflectional paradigms for nouns, verbs, adj, pronouns and determiners

## Vocabulary:
- mostly Germanic
- Borrowings from Latin (= Christianisation), some from Old Norse (= Viking raids)

![[image-58.png]]

# Syntactic cahnge: from OE to Present-day English

## Old English:
- synthetics (inflectional lang: relations between phrases expressed by inflectional morphemes)
- morphological case marking
- flexible word order with tendency to verb in second position (V2)

# Example of OE literary work: Beowulf

- Old English heroic poem
- only surviving ms from 10th/11th century
- oral composition c 725 in England --> originally orally composed
- relates events taking place about 6th century in Scandinavia and Northern Germany

---
# **Middle English: 1100/1150–1500**
---
# Middle English

## External History: 1066 - The Norman Conquest
- William the Conqueror won battle in Hastings
- English nobility replaced by William's followers
	- Anglo Normans
		- Spoke Norman French (= Anglo Norman)

## Social Function of Middle English:
- mostly a spoken language
- the languages of administration, learning and religious practice were Latin and French
	- a sit of **diglossia:** 
		- a society where two langs in use at same time
		- do not usually peacefully coincide --> vertical hierarchy
			- high (h) variety: used for formal sit and in powerful contexts
			- low (l) variety: used for everyday and informal interaction

# Example of ME literary work: Chaucer's Canterbury Tales

- authored at end of 14th century
- surviving in various manuscripts and various fragments
- **Never completed!**
- Frame narrative: Pilgrimage
	- pilgrims of all walks of life => depicts them and what happens to them
- Structure:
	- general prologue
	- sequence of tales by pilgrims, most of them with their own short prologue
	- wide variety of genres, representing variety of pilgrims

# Middle English: Some characteristics:

## Grammar:
- gradual loss of inflections
- gradual stabilisation of word order
--> both happen across the period

## Phonology:
- various sound changes --> what eng sounds like changes drastically
- beginning if the Great Vowel Shift

## Vocabulary:

#### Extensive borrowing from french:
- **Governmental and administrative words:**
	*government, crown, reign, royal*
- **Ecclesiastical words:** 
	*religion, sermon, baptism, friar, novice*
- **Army and navy:** 
	*army, navy, peace, arms, battle, guard, siege, lieutenant* 
- **Fashion, meals and social life:** 
	*fashion, dress, gown, robe, attire, cape, cloak, coat, frock, lace, dinner, supper, beef, veal, mutton, pork, bacon, sausage, oyster, leisure, dance, music, chess, conversation*
- **Art, learning, medicine:** 
	*art, painting, sculpture, study, logic, grammar, medicine, malady*

# Borrowing and word formation
- two main ways in which new words can enter a language

## Borrowing (= load words):
Words from foreign lang are started to be used in English:
- Latin *circus* has become and eng word
- process is called ***borrowing***, words that enter a lang through borrowing called ***load words***

## Word formation:
Existing words are combined with each other and/or transformed to form new words:
- **Compounding***: stonewall (stone + wall), fireproof (fire + proof)
- **Affixations:** unload (un + load), dirty (dirt + y)
- **Conversion:** bottle (noun) --> bottle (verb)
---
# **Early Modern English**: 1500 - 1700
---

# Early Modern English:
## External History: 1476 - Willian Caxton's Printing Press
- standarisation of English
- larger audiencefor texts --> increase in literacy
- early mass communication

## Functional diversification of English:
English is increasingly used due to impact of Caxton's printing press:
- as written lang --> french and latin lose impact
-  as lang of administration
- as lang of science and learning
- as lang of religion

--> lead to newsbooks and pamphlets

# Literacy

- increasing throughout early modern english period
- new group of readers from middle group of society

## Some numbers on literacy:

Literacy rates in England:

|      | Male | Female |
| ---- | ---- | ------ |
| 1500 | 10%  | 1%     |
| 1600 | 30%  | 1ß%    |
| 1700 | 50%  | 25%    |
The literacy rate in London was higher than the rest of England

--> Literacy figures are hard to estimate:
		One method: signing documents with either name or mark
		--> reading and writing were taught as separate skills

# Renaissance

- renewed interest in classical art and culture
- Science: new focus on empiricism and experiments
- Foundation of the Royal Society in 1662
	- first issue of the Philosophical Transactions published in 1665
- Vernacularisation: english as the lang for science, religion, law and government

# Exploration
--> founding steps of what came to be colonialism

- 1492: Christopher Columbus's first voyage across the Atlantic ocean
- 1600: East India Company founded
- Throughout the early modern period: Discovery of new Trade Routes in Asia, West Africa and the West Indies

# Reformation

- Bible translations
- Great Bible 1539
- Bishop’s Bible 1568
- King James Bible 1611
- English used as a language for religious instruction

# Health

- Plague outbreaks: frequent in the 16th and 17th century, big epidemics in 1603 and 1665-66
- New diseases from the new world (e.g. “French disease”)
- Increased mobility

# Shakespeare
--> central for early literary canon

- Famous for his lang experiments and coinage of new words
- his lang use has been documented in many grammars
- Most-cited author in Oxford English Dicxtionary:
	- More than 33,000 quotations 
	- Walter Scott: 15,000 
	- Milton and Chaucer: 11,000-12,000 
	- Dickens: 7,000
- at least in part due to high cultural importance of Shakespeare in late 19th century

# Linguistic developments in short

## Standarisation in writing:
- establishment of "one word: one spelling" principle
- normalisation of use of v and u and i, j, y --> graphamatic regularisation
	- no longer: vpon, haue, pryncypall, thi

## Growth of the lexicon:
- borrowing words for new concepts
	- coffee (Arab.), harem (Arab.), guru (Hindi), tea (Chin.)
- latin and greek borrowings as part of "Renaissance ideal of expressing an idea in as many ways as possible" (nurmi 2012:60)
	- emphasis, paradox, scholastic, economist, orthodox
- compounding anmd word formation
	- ceremoniously, countless, dislocate, distasteful

## Phonology:
- The Great Vowel Shift
- cat/pass split, put/cut split
	- cat and pass / put and cut no longer have the same vowel
- postvocalic /r/ dropping
	- /r/ no longer pronounced in words like far

## Morphology:
- vanishing of almost all traces of the old inflection and declination system
	- eyes instead of eyen; loss of verb endings except for 3rd person singular (e.g. goest)
- changes in the pronoun system: use of thou increasingly marked, confusion between you and ye --> you and ye merged
	- you becomes dominant form for 2nd person singular, except for specialised contexts (religion, verse)

## Syntax:
- continuation of trend of fixing word order
- increase of do-support (= h questions with: What do...?)
	- what do you read? instead of what read you?
- spread of progressive
	- I am reading (non-habitual)

# Sound changes: The Great Vowel Shift

- sound change that affected **long** vowels
- chain shift: series of changes
	- not just 1 sound --> a chain reaction
	- Long-term development:
		- First changes taking place in the fifteenth century (Late Middle English)
		- Last changes taking place in the eighteenth century (Late Modern English)
		- EModE: Many changes ongoing, some already completed, some not started yet


## Most likely sequence:

- Diphthongisation of /i:/ and /u:/ 
	- /i:/ > /ei/ (and later /ai/), e.g. life, side, time, write
	- /u:/ > /ou/, e.g. house, mouth, out, south 
- Raising of high-mid vowels /e:/ and /o:/ 
	- /e:/ > /i:/, e.g. meet, see, tree, piece 
	- /o:/ > /u:/, e.g. loose, moon, move, tooth
- Raising of low-mid vowels /ɛ:/ and /ɔ:/ 
	- /ɛ:/ > /e:/ (and later /i:/), e.g. meat, please, sea 
	- /ɔ:/ > /o:/, e.g. boat, home, rose, soap, stone 
- Raising of the low vowel /a:/ 
	- /a:/ > /ɛ:/ , e.g. case, late, make, name, take

# **Late modern English
---

# Late Modern English

## External History:
- 1755 Samuel Johnson's Dictionnary of Eng lang --> marker of increasing standardisation
- tch innovations leading to industrial revolution
- geographic mobility and urbanisation
	- dialect travelling --> they lose importance
- compulsury free elementary schooling
	- exposure to standard eng --> more standardisation

## Language internal history:
change slows down a bit
- little categorical change
- often referred to as period of prescriptivism and standardisation
	- increasing num of prescriptive grammars --> class conciousness

# Present-day English

## External History:
- When does the most recent period start?
	- 1906: First radio broadcast
	- 1989: World Wide Web

## New uses of English that affect language development:
- eng as world lang
- diversification of eng: new englishes
- eng as a lingua Franca in business and science
- New types of mass media:
	- Radio and TV: Spoken mass communication
	- Internet: Mass communication without gatekeepers
	- Social media: Private mediated communication with public visibility (first written, increasingly spoken and multimodal)
