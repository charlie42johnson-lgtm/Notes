# Meaning in linguistics:

## Semantics:
Discipline of meaning on a lexical level
•	mostly concerned with word meaning
•	mostly concerned with meaning as independent from language use —> e.g. meaning as recorded in dictionaries 
      ==> dictionary gives stable meaning (independent, lexical etc.) 
      ==> independent of specific speaker —> e.g. “Chair” ; everyone has a diff. image (colour, size, style etc. …) but general meaning stays the same

## Pragmatics:
Discipline of meaning in a bigger context —> sentence level
•	mostly concerned with meaning at the utterance of/ sentence level (and above)
•	mostly concerned with meaning in language use —> context-dependent meaning:
      ==> meaning in language use socially situated situation:  speaker-hearer-context / cultural-context / temporal-context etc.
             e.g. saying stuff in uni vs. at the dinner table

# Semiotics: The study of signs

•	study of language as a sign system
•	very original of thinking of language as a system or structure

## Saussure’s model of the linguistic sign:
•	language as a sign system ==> the linguistic sign 

Ferdinand Saussure (1857-1913) —> Swiss linguist and philosopher, working in semiotics
•	semiotics: how form and meaning come together

Argued linguistic signs consist of two components (always consists of these two components):
#### •	signifier (signifiant):
sound pattern, image, or written word that evokes a concept ==> e.g. hearing ‘flower’ or seeing it written
#### •	signified (signifié): 
concept that —> that which is evoked by the sound pattern ==> e.g. the idea of the flower that is evoked by hearing flower / seeing flower written

The link between signifier and signified is arbitrary but conventional —> doesn’t matter what it is called

## Pierce’s typology of signs:
•	typology —> plays on notion of arbitrairyness

Charles Sanders Pierce (1839-1914), American mathematician and philosopher 


### Distinguishes three types of signs (typology):
#### •	Icon: 
iconic signs share a visual or auditory similarity with the signified ==> e.g. idiograms, drawing, cartoons …
#### •	Index (pl.: indeces): 
indexical signs stand in a cause-effect relationship with the signified ==> smoke = fire —> see smoke signifier so there must be fire
#### •	Symbol: 
symbolic signs are completely arbitrary, based on convention —> no reason why it evokes certain meaning
##### Linguistic signs are symbols!
•	form of words are a matter of convention
•	bear an arbitrary relation to signified


There are a few **exceptions**:
#### •	Iconic: 
onomatopoeic (auditory relation between sound and word) words ==> splash, click, hiccup, cuckoo
#### •	Indexical: 
exclamations ==> ha and oh, hesitators ==> uh and uhm
—> directly caused by our effective reaction —> linguistic signs of effect of brain processing

# Philosophical approaches to meaning: Sense and reference:

## The referential view:

Meaning of word or expression: the entity that the expression identifies in the world (***the*** ***referent***)

•	an expression (signifier) refers to a real life entity
e.g. 
“<span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">The</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">president</span>, who is 79, drew fire two weeks ago after he told a Bloomberg 
reporter to be "quiet, piggy" when she tried to ask a follow-up question about 
disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's emails.”
•	‘<span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">The</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">president</span>’ —> referent to Donald Trump

#### BUT:

“***The*** ***President*** is responsible for implementing and enforcing the laws written 
by Congress and, to that end, appoints the heads of the Federal agencies, 
including the Cabinet.”
•	‘The ***President***’ not referring to a specific president —> it is the role of ‘the President’

Problem —> Japan does not have a ***president***


## Problems of the referential view:

•	words that don’t have a referent —> no one, unicorn, the President of Japan
•	words whose referential meaning changes depending on context —> here, now, I, yesterday ==> deictic expressions
•	words or expressions that refer to same entity
      —> why would we need several words to refer to the same entity if the meaning of words have restricted to identifying referents?

## Sense and reference:

Gottlob Frege (1848-1925), German mathematician and philosopher 

### Reference:
•	entity (in real world) that the expression stands for / identifies / refers to
•	also called extensional meaning

### Sense:
•	cognitive significance if an expression —> more like Saussure, cognitive abstraction
•	also called intensional meaning

#### Example:

Venus, aka the morning star, aka the evening star

| Reference:                                                                     | Sense:                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| the morning star = the evening star<br>—> referring to the same spatial entity | “the morning star" ≠ “the evening star”<br>  seen in morning        seen in evening<br>—> concept is different |

# Structualist approaches: Componential analysis:
•	more structuralist
•	lexical entities segmented

## Componential Analysis:
•	comparing one word to others

Meaning of word or expression: set of all relationships a word has with other words —> look at it through looking at its components

Semantic analysis involves:
1.	Systematically comparing and contrasting related words —> lexical field of terms semantically in the same area
2.	Summarising similarities and contrasts in the most economical way —> we find bits of meaning that we can say are either present or absent in a word
#### —> Componential analysis


## Lexical decomposition:

Word meanings are decomposed into distinct meaning components or features

Aim: finding smallest number of binary dimensions of contrast possible:

| Word:   | Components / features: |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| "woman" | +FEMALE, +ADULT        |
| "man"   | -FEMALE, +ADULT        |
| "girl"  | +FEMALE, -ADULT        |
| "boy"   |  -FEMALE, -ADULT<br>   |
![[WhatsApp Image 2026-01-10 at 05.52.24.jpeg|268x126]]

•	annotate lexical items with meaning components (sememes)


## Necessary and sufficient conditions:

Componential analysis: words defined in terms of individually necessary and jointly sufficient criteria

#### Example: 
criteria for  X to be a BACHELOR
•	X is human             [+HUMAN]
•	X is male                [+MALE]
•	X is adult                [+ADULT]
•	X is unmarried        [-MARRIED]

#### The criteria are:
•	individually **necessary**: if any one criteria not met, X is not a bachelor
•	Jointly **sufficient**: if all criteria satisfied, X is a bachelor


## Problems of componential analysis: Buzz groups:

#### FURNITURE:
•	identification of features:
      —> features can be arbitrary
      —> whether or not a feature is relevant ca depend on context
      —> identification of “useful” features difficult
•	restriction to binary features:
      —> aspects of gender: [+MALE] [+FEMALE] —> ?
•	No universal inventory of semantic features
•	Fixed category boundaries
      —> What about peripheral members?

---

# Psychological approaches: Prototype theory:

## Family resemblances:

Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), Austrian-born British philosopher 

Developed concept of family resemblances:
•	set of criteria that are shared by many (not all) members of a categroy
•	each member of a category shares several (not all) criteria
•	no single criterion is necessary
—> fuzzy boundary of lexical concepts that share certain criteria but not all

e.g. ‘games’ —> ‘olympic-games’, ‘board-games’, ‘ball-games’, ‘card-games’, etc.

## Fuzzy boundaries of categories:

•	Experimental study by Labov (1973)
•	Investigation of subjects’ naming of line drawings illustrating cups, mugs, vases, bowls etc.
      —> one image at a time
      —> different randomised orders
•	only some items reliably assigned to one particular category
•	responses could be influenced by contextual conditions
      —> imagining person holding object in hand and drinking from it —> contextual knowledge went into this

![[WhatsApp Image 2026-01-10 at 05.54.39.jpeg|221x329]]



## Prototype theory:

Eleanor Rosch, American Psychologist —> specialises in cognitive psychology 

•	experimental research
•	speakers of different (especially non-Indo-European) languages
•	Different types of tests:
      —> Production tests (category given and must name as many members of it as possible)
      —> Rating test (assess whether X is a typical member of category Y)
      —> Priming tests (measuring response times in recognition tasks depending on whether or not a category label was provided)
      —> …

### Notion of universal:
•	explores the links between language and thinking
•	interested in universals
      —> do all humans distinguish same set of colours? —> a universal colour semantic
      —> do speakers of all languages distinguish same set of basic shapes? —> a universal shape semantic

### Example: Birds

Some birds are better representatives of the class “bird” than others 
•	more readily associated with term “bird”
•	combine more features that are typical of birds (flying, singing voice etc.)

Category-members don’t all share same attributes:
•	different positions in category
•	neighbouring members share attributes 

Marginal members share attributes with neighbouring categories:
•	clear boundaries not always necessary

## Prototypes: Further examples:

Prototypes are items of category that are:
•	cognitively most easy to retrieve
•	perceived to be most typical of category (the ‘birdiest’ bird)
•	items that are visualised when thinking of category
•	typically share many of the “family resemblance” categories
•	culture-specific

## Componential analysis vs. Prototype theory:

### Componential analysis: 
•	originates in logic
•	categories defined in terms of a set of necessary and sufficient features
•	categories have clear boundaries 
•	features are binary, i.e. feature can either be present [+], or absent [-]
•	all members of category have equal status, i.e. no degrees of membership in a category
•	features are universal, abstract linguistic concepts
•	innate to entities / objects

### Prototype theory:
•	originates in psychology
•	categories not structured in terms of a shared set of features, but by a crisscrossing network of similarities
•	categories have fuzzy boundaries
•	attributes not binary constructs but variables on a continuum, at a dimension of meaning
•	not all members of a category have equal status; some birds are “better” birds than others
•	attributes are not abstract entities or linguistics
•	language users assign them to objects on the basis of their encyclopaedic knowledge

# Meaning relations:
•	relation between individual lexical entities

![[WhatsApp Image 2026-01-10 at 05.57.16.jpeg]]


## Synonymy and antonymy:

### Synonymy:
semantic equivalence (same meaning)
##### Note: 
Total synonymy is very rare / inexistent, near-synonyms vary with respect to:
•	range of contexts where they can be applied / collocates they can take (e.g. deep vs. profound, Big Brother vs. Large Brother)
•	connotations, style, register (e.g. baby vs. neonate, begin vs. commence) —> depends on context
•	regional and social dialects (e.g. truck vs. lorry)

### Antonymy:
Opposite in meaning, incompatible 

| Complementary antonyms:                      | Gradable antonyms:                                               | Relational antonyms:                                                                      | Directional antonyms:                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| either/or relations                          | more or less on a continuum (in between there are more meanings) | same role-relationship from different perspectives (only exist in relation to each other) | pposite direction                                         |
| —> asleep - awake, dead - alive, pass - fail | —> warm - cold, old - young                                      | —> employer - employee, buy - sell                                                        | —> open - shut, rise - fall, come - go, above - below<br> |

# Hierarchical relations:

## Hyperonymy / Hyponymy:
•	one item is a kind of another item
•	Taxonymy relationship: ‘is a kind of’
![[image-28.png|272x222]]

## Meronymy:
•	part-whole relationship: ‘is a part of’
![[image-29.png|276x205]]


---

# Lexical ambiguity:

## Homonymy:

### Homonyms:
•	identical forms with different meanings
•	e.g. bark:
      —> sound dog makes
      —> part of tree
##### Note:
•	no transparent link (metaphorical link) between the meanings
•	homonyms have separate lexical entities in a dictionary
***Homonyms are both homographs and homophones***

### Homographs:
•	written the same but pronounced differently
•	e.g. lead:
      —> /led/ ‘kind of metal’
      —> /liːd/ ‘piece of leather attached to dog collar’

### Homophones:
•	pronounced the same but spelt differently
•	e.g. 
      —> sea vs. see
      —> flower vs. flour

## Polysemy:

### Polysemy:
•	word that has different, but related, meanings
•	e.g. 
      —> mouth: body, river, cave entry
      —> wing: bird, airplane, building
•	much more frequent than homonymy
•	practically every word is polysemous to some extent
•	distinguishing polysemy and homonymy not always trivial and may require etymological knowledge

##### Note:
•	link between the meanings (metaphorical meaning link) can be reconstructed
•	no separate entries in dictionary (sub-meanings are listed)
