# Different research approaches in linguistics

## Research approaches in linguistics

### armchair approaches:
- based on intuition, on philosophical reflection, or on rational thinking
	- imagined examples, grammaticality judgements, acceptability judgements, appropriateness judgements
- example of a possible research question
	- pragmatics -> speech acts: what does it mean to apologise?
- ##### advantages: 
	- direct access to native speaker competence
	- infinite number of possible sentences
- ##### disadvantages: 
	- unreliable
	- subjective 
	- not testable

### laboratory approaches:
- based on experiments: language is produced for the purpose of research
- example of a possible research question
	- field: pragmatics -> discourse completion tasks: Blum-Kulka & House (CCSARP Study) -> investigated the degree of directness in requests depending on different social situations with DCTs
- ##### advantages: 
	- scientific standards of observation 
	- intersubjective
	- replicability
- ##### disadvantages: 
	- artificiality

### field approaches
- observation based on corpora of actual spoken/written language, recordings, transcripts of naturally occurring speech samples, any type of language that was produced outside the purpose of a linguistic research study
- example of a possible research question
	- pragmatics: how were requests formulated in Shakespeare’s Hamlet?
- ##### advantages: 
	- based on actual (real) language use
	- allows statements about frequency/distribution
	- results are replicable
- ##### disadvantages: 
	- corpora are finite
	- generalisations are difficult
	- limited precision/recall

## Precision and recall
- precision & recall are measures of quality for search queries
### precision:
= how many of the hits you found are correct?
- calculation: 
	- number of correct hits / total number of hits
### recall 
= how many of the relevant instances did you find?
- calculation: 
	- number of correct hits / total number of relevant instances in the corpus

## Types of frequencies

### absolute numbers:
number of instances that were observed 
- can provide an indication on the reliability of observed differences
- are NOT suitable for comparing frequencies across data sets of different sizes
### normalised frequencies:
number of instances per number of words
- ARE suitable for comparing frequencies across data sets of different sizes 
- need to be calculated in the same way for each data set
- formula: 
	- number of observed instances / number of words in data set * common base
### percentages:
-percentage of subtype of a certain phenomenon in relation to other subtypes
- can be used to compare data sets of different sizes if done correctly
- careful about choosing a suitable basis for calculating percentages!

## Competence and Performance:

#### Competence: 
- Internalized knowledge of one’s (native) language
#### Performance: 
- Actual instances of language use that are produced on the basis of this knowledge

# Publication process of academic research

## How research is published:

### Example of the successful publication of a peerreviewed journal article (Part 1):

### Example of the successful publication of a peerreviewed journal article (Part 2):

### Why so many steps?

#### --> Quality control!!

- many steps lead to greater quality control
- research that is published in highly-regarded peer-reviewed journals & book series has been read by many pairs of eyes
- several experts in the field had to assess the text as presenting research that meets the quality standards of the field 
	- if you consult such research, you can be relatively confident that it’s not entirely wrong
	- typical website solely relies on author’s eyes

# Types of academic publications and how to find them


## Major types of academic publications:
	
### Not original research:
- ##### textbooks: 
	- introduce students to (a field/topic of) linguistics
	- written in an accessible style
	- may include exercises
	- often have glossaries with relevant terminology
- ##### handbooks: 
	- describe a field of research in a comprehensive manner
		- target audience are other researchers/advanced students individual chapters are written by different authors as commissioned work
	- usually very large & heavy, tend to include very long lists of references
	- good place to start reading if u want to gain an overview of a research field
- ##### reference grammars & dictionaries:
	- comprehensive description of the grammar of the English language/spoken & written
- ##### book reviews

### Original research:
- ##### journal articles: 
	- articles published in academic journals
	- journals differ with respect to their “prestige” (often manifested in rejection rates)
	- only original research can be published in the form of research articles
	- journals are usually devoted to a specific topic, nowadays mostly published online
- ##### research articles published in edited volumes: 
	- books that include articles on a given topic
	- each contribution is written by another author
	- edited by an editor or group of authors, often appear within a book series
- ##### research monographs: 
	- books that are written by a single author/group
	- present original research by the authors
	- structure similar to a research article but longer
	- often appear within a book series (and the same book series may include edited volumes)

## How to find literature:
- MLA International Bibliography (databases)
- HEIDI (library catalogue)
- handbooks
- Google Scholar
