# **Language in use, meaning in context**

## How can utterances acquire meaning that goes beyond the literal meaning of the words included in the utterance?

- communication models of language
- Grice's cooperative principle
	- implicatures
- Deixis (short): speaker-based meaning

## How do we use language to perform actions, rather than just communicate information?

- speech acts (detailed): how to do things with words?
	- Austin:
		- locution, illocution, perlocution
	- Searle:
		- felicity conditions 
		- speech act types
Austin and Searle both came up with different forms of explinations


# Language in use

- we can study phone, phono, morphology, syntax, semantics **without really paying any systematic attention** to intentions, context or effects
#### BUT in pragmatics its different:
- focus is on **the utterance in its specific communicative context**, and its relation to **the intentions of the speaker and the response of the listener**
-- Mair (2015)

Pragmatics examines how speakers understand and communicate more the the literal meaning of words or sentences
##### Pragmatics investigates **language in use**:
- lang in real-life situations
	- langue vs parole 
		- langue: hypothetical —> semantics
		- parole: actual language in real life —> pragmatics
- lang as context dependent
- lang as inter-speaker dependent
- lang as (social) action

---

# **Language as communication**

### Basic pragmatic insight:
lang should not exclusively be analysed as self-sufficient structure but as a tool which speakers and hearers (+ writers and readers) use to achieve certain comm ends

!! from sign models (semantics) to communication models (pragmatics)

## Linguistic communication models:

##### Karl Bühler —> Organonmodell
![[image-30.png]]
- was an obvious idea that had not been articulated yet
- Y = Zeichen = Sign

##### Roman Jackobson, Model of communicative functions
![[image-31.png]]
- beginning of seeing language with function

#### —> theories of 1920s - 1930s
- language as communication and action

--- 

# **Speech acts: talking about vs doing**

---

- meaning and function of an utterance are distinct from each other
- utterances amount to the execution of an act
- we do things with an utterance —> utterance changes state of the world
—> communication is interaction rather than passing on of info

**Examples:**
- "I name this ship Queen Elizabeth."
- "I give and bequeath my watch to my brother."

**Characteristics:**
- 1st person, present tense, active —> speaker centric quality
- not true or false, but **felicitous** or **non-felicitous**
	-  whether or not performative sentence is felicitous depends on many factors, including context in which it was uttered
- uttering the sentence is part of performing an action
	- e.g. "I pronounce you husband and wife." —> world changed: people now married
# What is speech act?

## Two perspectives:

| A specific type of utterance that does not assert information but that carries out an action                                                                       | A property of utterances that is related to the performance of actions                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prototypical Examples:**<br>“I name this ship the Queen Elizabeth”<br>“I bet you sixpence it will rain tomorrow”<br>“I give and bequeath my watch to my brother” | **Examples:**<br>“Good morning Mrs Johnstone”<br>“I like your new haircut”, “You have a fancy new haircut!”<br>“I really wanted to be on time but my train was delayed” |
| Austin's early view                                                                                                                                                | Austin's later view                                                                                                                                                     |
| later rejected as "marginal cases"                                                                                                                                 | speech acts as specific illocutionary functions of utterances                                                                                                           |

# Speech act theory
- makes it graspable to explain utterance
	- language in use —> what happens when someone utters something

| Locutionary act:                                                                                                                                                             | Illocutionary act:                                                                                                            | Perlocutionary act:                                                                                                                                                 |

# John Searle's speech acts
(1932-2025)
Speech acts (1969)

- developed a theory of speech acts,  building on Austin's work
- focus of illocutions, especially the distinction between illocutionary force and propositional context of an utterance
- distinguishes five basic actions that can be performed by speaking
- describes systematically which conditions need to be met so that a speech act is successful (felicity conditions)

## Speech act theory:

According to Searle speech acts can be classified according to their function/illocutionary point:

S = speaker
H = hearer

| Speech act category:       | Function (illocutionary point (force)):                        | Examples:                             |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Representatives/assertives | contain certain statement about the worlds (true/false)        | describe, claim, insist               |
| directives                 | attempts by S to get H to do something <br>= hearer orientated | order, request, ask                   |
| commissives                | commit S to perform some future action                         | promise, swear, guarantee             |
| epressives                 | express psychological state or certain attitudes of S          | thank, greet, apologise, congratulate |
| declarations               | bring about changes in the status of the object referred to    | baptise, fire, marry                  |

# Direct and indirect speech acts:

**Problem:** how can we identify the illocutionary force of a speech act?
## Direct speech acts:

-  sometimes illocution collides with locution in form of associated sentence types
![[image-40.png]]

## Indirect speech acts:

-  often illocution not directly predictable from locution (co-construction, reading cues)
-  illocution has to be inferred by hearer (e.g. through shared background knowledge)
-  some indirect speech acts are conventional; others produced ad hoc 
	- only know through context
![[image-41.png]]


## Direct and indirect speech acts:

#### One locution, many possible illocutions:
##### "It looks like rain."

|                  | Example meaning:              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Complaint        | You left the window open.     |
| Neutral          | statement                     |
| Advice           | You should bring an umbrella. |
| Order            | Bring the washing in.         |
| Proposal         | Let's go inside.              |
| Decline of offer | I'd rather stay at home.      |

# Felicity conditions

##### **conditions that must be fulfilled so that a speech act is successfully realised**

as speech acts are performative there are certain preconditions attached to how they carried out:
Example: "I pronounce you man and wife."
- have to have two people
- legal age
- want to get married
- legal documents
- etc.
##### Speech acts can be felicitous (successful) or infelicitous (unsuccessful)

## Searle's felicity conditions

> “We need to specially and critically to establish with respect to each kind of illocutionary act—warnings, estimates, verdicts, statements, and descriptions—what if any is the specific way in which they are intended, first to be in order or not in order, and second, to be ‘right’ or ‘wrong’; what terms of appraisal and disappraisal are used for each and what they mean.” (Austin 1962: 147)

Searle tried to come up with principled way of classifying speech acts:

### Felicity conditions:
- **Propositional content condition:** 
	What the speech act is about = relevance
- **Preparatory condition:**
	What sit needs to be given that speech act can be carried out? = physical fitness, etc.
- **Sincerity condition:**
	The speaker must be sincere in their attempt of the speech act
- **Essential condition:**
	The way in which the speech act is realised must count as attempt to carry out the speech act

# **Cooperation**

---
# Speech acts as cooperative:

A: What time is it?
B: Well, the news has just started.

- is felicitous = meaning inferred
- But how?

# Grice's cooperative principle

The basic idea that underlines **Grice's cooperative principle** is that **communicating is cooperative behavior**, so all communication proceeds under the assumption that **the speaker and hearer want to cooperate**.

### In Gricean pragmatics:
- cooperation considered to be central concept (the foundation) in human rational interaction and social cognition
- cooperation as a **procedural role (= descriptive)**, not as moral/normative rule (= prescriptive)

---

# The cooperative principle

“Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged” 
(Grice 1975: 45)
*= your contribution should fit into the conversation*

It can be broke down into four specific rules: 
#### = the Maxims of Conversation

## Maxim of Quantity:
##### 1. Make your contribution as informative as is required for the current purpose
"Grandma: How‘s school? 
Grandson: Alright."
—> not what grandma had in mind (more detail)
##### 2. Do not make your contribution more informative as is required for the current purpose
Cashier: How are you today? 
Customer: Actually my cousin had a blazing row with his girlfriend last night, so she comes round to my house crying, and he calls demanding to know if she’s there, and it was all bit chaotic and stressful. On the plus side though, I won twenty quid on the lottery and we got a letter from the management (…)

*= essentially speak as much as necessary, but not more*

## Maxim of Quality:

##### Make your contribution one that is true
##### 1. Do not say what you believe to be false
"I just love getting up in the mornings for work"
—> a lie

##### 2. Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence
"A: Have you read any Shakespeare?
B: Sure, I particularly like his novels"

*= essentially don't lie*

## Maxim of Relation:

##### Be relevant
"A: I had a terrible flu the other week. 
B: Yes, my friend had the flu last week too. Must be something going around"

*= essentially say relevant things

## Maxim of Manner:

##### Be perspicuous (clearly expressed and easily understood; lucid): 
1. **Avoid obscurity of expression**
2. **Avoid ambiguity**
3. **Be brief** 
4. **Be orderly**
"You need to take your pie out of the oven. Before that, let it bake for 30 minutes. Butter your form. Preheat the oven. Slice the apples. And first, get all the ingredients ready."

*= essentially be clear in what you are saying*

---

# Non-cooperation

- cooperative principle is very fundamental so we assume speakers and hearers are cooperating
- BUT: speakers can and do fail to fulfil maxims of conversations

Grice points out different forms:

##### VIOLATING a maxim:
- quietly and subtly, i.e. *without signaling* the violation to the hearer
A: Where have you been? 
B: (lying) At the office

##### FLOUTING (=openly disregard) a maxim
- blatantly, i.e. *signaling* the flouting to the hearer
A: Where have you been? 
B: Out.
—> speaker wants the hearer to know they are lying/withholding info


## Conversational implicature:

When maxims are flouted, it leads to a mechanism which Grice calls **Conversational Implicature**

When maxim/s are flouted hearer is alerted to look for additional info that may help to make the utterance meaningful and cooperative
- flouting triggers mechanism of **inference**
	A: When will dinner be ready? 
	B: It’s a very small chicken
- maxims not obeyed on surface level
- still we assume interactants are cooperative

# **Deixis**
- corresponds to Greek verb *deiknyani*: to point / to show
- refers to all linguistic means that  mainly to do with (verbally) pointing at extralinguistic contexts
	- all linguistics expressions that are used to point are called deictics / deictic expressions


# Referential meaning vs deictic meaning

| Referential                              | Deictic                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

# Deictic expressions

- Deixis can be expressed through diff categories
- Most important ones:
	- PLACE - TIME - PERSON
- The deictic centre of an utterance is the **origo**:
	- I - HERE - NOW
—> utterances get interpreted from the deictic centre of the speaker
	—> who when where is spoken

# Deixis and context

successful processing of deictic elements depends on level of context available to speakers and hearers
—> shared communicative situation
E.g.
	"**This one here** is a pretty big **one**"
