# Word Formation Processes

## Some terminology

- **Neologism:** new word
- **Nonce (ad hoc) formations:** "formations which at least the word creator is convinced never to have heard or read before" (Kortmann)
- **Institutionalisation:** neologism is used by other members of lang community = thus stops being a  neologism
- **Productivity:** whether or not a word formation process creates many new words

# Lexical innovation and word formation
- not looking at morphological word formation in close sense

## Word formation processes:
![[image-105.png]]
- some word formation processes add more to lang than others

## Semantic shift:

**Existing words acquire new meaning** = taking diff. stuff and instilling diff. semantic meaning
- more concrete to more abstract
- morphological material does not change = semantic does

![[image-106.png]]
- undergone semantic shift due to tech innovation
- comp mouse has similar shape to mouse
- tail structure with cable
- analogies = resemblance

![[image-107.png]]
- due to tech innovation it has evolved
- semantic shift tends to the more abstract and more metaphorical words

## Borrowings from other languages:

## Eponymy and adoption of brand names:
-  nym is greek root for name

### Eponyms: Proper names turn into words
- atlas: Atlas (greek mythology)
- champagne: Champagne (region in france)
- sandwich: Sandwich (4th earl of Sandwich)

### Brand names:
- google: to use the google search engine --> named after large number googol (10 to power of 100), coined in 1930s
- xerox: to photocopy --> also a borrowing: xeros = dry in Old greek
- hoover: to use a vacuum cleaner --> also an eponym!

**"The vast majority of new words is thus formed  by modifying existing ones"** (Mair)

# Derivation
- can change word meaning or word class
	- word class = noun, adjective, verb, etc.

## Suffixation:
- suffixation tends to change word class
![[image-110.png]]

## Prefixation:

#### Word-class maintaining: = meaning changes but word class stays same
- un-: unkind, uncertain
- dis-: dislike, distrust
- re-: recycle, remove
- post-: post-truth, post-fact (Prazmo 2019)

#### Word-class changing: changes meaning and also word class
- be-: befriend, bedevil, bewitch, behead, belittle
- en-: enjoy, enlist, enslave, enlarge, enrich
	- some productivity: e.g. en-shitification

# Compounding
- two free morphemes combined = free morpheme + free morpheme
![[image-111.png]]
- almost any kind of free morpheme can go with any other free morpheme

## Primary stress:
- takes the primary stress of the first syllable

| **Compound**  |                    | **Phrase**   |                    |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------ |
| 'blackbird    | the species        | black 'bird  | just a black bird  |
| 'darkroom<br> | where develop pics | dark 'room   | just a dark room   |
| 'small talk   | chit chat          | small 'talk  | just a small talk  |
| 'short story  | type of story      | short 'story | just a short story |
| 'White House  | where pres lives   | white 'house | just a white house |
#### In addition:
- not separable (* a dark large room)
- no modification of first element (* a very White House)
- not compositional: meaning exceeds meaning of parts (e.g a blackbird is not just any bird that is black)

## Headedness:
- one free morpheme has to supply meaning
	- how the word class is defined

### Head:
- In english: the head is the right element in a compound = **often** **but** **not** **always**
- defines the word class of the compound
- usually defines main meaning of compound:
	- water**bed**: special type of bed
	- head**strong**: special type of strong
	- proof**read**: special type of reading
	- 


---

# Semantic types

## Endocentric compounds: --> most common
- A + B = special kind of B
- water(A)bed(B)

## Exocentric compounds: -->meaning outside the A + B parts
- A + B = something metonymically related to B
- pick(A)pocket(B), skin(A)head(B)

## Appositional compounds: 
- A + B = alternative and complementary descriptions
- singer(A)-songwriter(B)

## Copulative compounds: --> rather rare
- A + B = sum of A + B
- sleep(A)walk(B) --> literally sleeping + walking


---

# Derivation or compounding?

## Derivation:
## free morpheme + derivational affix

#### But less clear from diachronic perspective:
- neighbour-**hood**
- wis-**dom**
- friend-**ly**
- like-**wise**
--> used to be free morphemes in earlier periods of eng
Today: derivational suffixes

## Compounding:
## free morpheme + free morpheme

- disc-**man**, walk-**man**
--> compounds consisting of two free morphemes
morpheme *man* could potentially develop into a derivational suffix

# Conversion (zero derivation)

### noun > verb:  
bottle, butter, bicycle, carpet, father, knife, mother, mail, queue, ship, shoulder

### adjective > verb: 
better, calm, dirty, dry, empty, faint, idle, open, pale, right, total, wrong

### verb > noun: 
cough, cover, desire, doubt, guess, love, rise, smell, smile, spy, turn, want

### conjunction > noun: 
**ifs** and **buts** 
### preposition > verb: 
to **up** the prices, to **down** a beer

# Shortenings

## Clippings:  
- shortening of a word without changing its word  class or meaning
- literally taking something away
- Examples:
	- exam (< examination), bus (< omnibus), flu (< influenza)

## Blends:
- combining two words into one
- Examples:
	-  brunch (< breakfast + lunch), blog (< web + log), slanguage (< slang + language)

## Acronyms:
- **PRONOUNCED AS A WORD!!!**
- Examples:
	- laser, radar, asap, UNESCO, RAM, ERASMUS

## Alphabetisms / Initialisms:
-  **PRONOUNCED AS LETTERS!!!**
- Examples:
	- TV, DJ, OED, IPA, ADHD

## Back formations:
- looks like opposite of derivation: removing part of word that could be derivational affix
- usually changes meaning and/or word class
- Examples:
	- edit (< editor), donate (< donation), self-destruct (< self-destruction), 
	 babysit (< babysitter)
