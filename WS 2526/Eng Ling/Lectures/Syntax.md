# Encoding Grammar in language

**"all languages use the same four fundamental strategies"** (Mair)

1. Inflection
2. Free grammatical morphemes (function words)
3. Word order
4. Intonation
--> a matter of relative prominence

## Inflection
### inflectional morphology:
![[image-9.png]]
- in the course of its history english has shed most of its inflectional endings

## Function words
- use of free grammatical morphemes (prepositions, auxiliaries, pronouns, etc.) to encode gramm info
	- e.g. 
		English: **we will** have
		vs.
		Spanish: **tendremos**

## Word order:

- in modern eng word order is one of most important ways of coding gramm relations in a sentence
--> changes in the order of constituents often lead to changes in meaning or to **ungrammaticality**:

| Jim ate the hamburger.    | * The hamburger ate Jim.  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Jim aß den Hamburger.** | **Den Hamburger aß Jim.** |

## Intonation and tone:
- prosodic features of pitch variation as encoding gramm function (as opposed to pragmatic, attitudinal, discourse and other aspects)
- Particularly important in tonal languages:
	- e.g. Bantu languages: gramm info, such as past vs present, I vs you conveyed solely by tone
- BUT: also relevant in english:
	- He is a student. -- He is a student?
	- My uncle(,) who lives in London(,) got married last week.

# Morphological language types

![[image-11.png]]

## Isolating:
- word structure simple; no bound forms
- one word form per lexeme
- Examples:
	- Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai

NOT NEED TO REMEMBER,  ONLY TO HELP VISUALISE
Mandarin Chinese deeper look: "Gŏu bú xĭhuān chī qīngcài" = ‘Dogs don’t like to eat vegetables’

| gŏu     | bú      | xĭhuān   | chī     | qīngcài       |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------------- |
| **dog** | **not** | **like** | **eat** | **vegetable** |

## Agglutinating:
- word structure complex; one morpheme has one meaning only
- Examples:
	- Turkish, Swahili

NOT NEED TO REMEMBER,  ONLY TO HELP VISUALISE
Turkish deeper look: ‘gelemeyeceğim’ = I will not be able to come.

| gel      | e           | mey          | eceğ       | im             |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| **come** | **be-able** | **Negative** | **Future** | **1st Person** |

## Inflectional:
- word structure complex;
- portmanteau morphemes: a single morpheme can take (or encode) several meanings
- stem alternations: no clear segmentation into morphemes possible
- Examples:
	- French, Latin, German

NOT NEED TO REMEMBER,  ONLY TO HELP VISUALISE
French deeper look: ‘réalisait’ = realised

| réal     | is       | ait                    |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| **real** | **Verb** | **3rd Pers. Sg. Past** |

## Polysynthetic:
- polysynthetic langs at extreme end of the continuum --> several morphemes per word
- elements that are often occur as separate words in other langs (such as arguments of the verb) are expressed morphologically
- Example:
	- Western Greenlandic (polysynthetic **and** agglutinating)

NOT NEED TO REMEMBER,  ONLY TO HELP VISUALISE
Western Greenlandic deeper look:
‘Aliikusersuillammassuaanerartassagaluarpaalli’ 
= However, they will say that he is a great entertainer, but ...

| aliiku        | sersu   | i         | llammas     | sua | a        | nerar | ta  | ssa      | galuar            | paal | li  |
| ------------- | ------- | --------- | ----------- | --- | -------- | ----- | --- | -------- | ----------------- | ---- | --- |
| **entertainment** | **provide** | **SEMITRANS** | **one.good.at** | **COP** | **say.that** | **REP**   | **FUT** | **sure.but** | **3.PL.SUBJ/3SG.OBJ** | **but**  |     |

## What morphological type is English?
- most langs cannot be classified neatly as belonging to exactly one morphological type!

| Inflectional                                  | Agglutinating                              | Isolating                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Portmanteau morphemes                         | complex word  structure                    | one morpheme per word                      |
| no clear segmentation into morphemes possible | one meaning per morpheme                   | word order defines grammatical role        |
| The geese ran<br>She sings                    | unhappiness<br>antidiestablishmentarianism | the cat bit the dog<br>the dog bit the cat |
### -->Long-term development: From inflectional to isolating -->
- Eng displays morphological properties from diff types
- overall has more similarities to isolating langs like Chinese Mandarin than to Latin or Greek

# Word classes / parts of speech

### Word class:
a group of words which, from gramm pov, behave in the same way

- **Morphological similarities:** same inflections
- **Syntactic similarities:** same positions within a sentence
- **Semantic similarities:** similar types of meanings, e.g. name of a person, place or thing

### Commonly distinguished word classes:

- ### Open / lexical word classes:
	- nouns
	- verbs
	- adjectives
	- adverbs
- ### Closed / grammatical / functional word classes:
	- determiners (including articles)
	- pronouns
	- auxiliaries
	- prepositions, conjunctions

# Word classes: Problems

#### Word classes are abstractions:

not all words fall neatly into a single word class
- under as a preposition and adverb
- need as main verb and modal verb
	- This ***does not need to*** be the case.
	- This ***need not*** be the case.

not all words  of a word class share all properties
- non-count nouns do not inflect for number
- modal verbs do not inflect for tense
- some adverbs do not take modifiers
	- * very only

not everyone draws the boundaries between word classes in the same way
- my, their: pronoun or determiner?

- **Articles:** a, the
- **Determiners:** include other forms that can occur in the position of articles:
	- Possessive determiners: my house, their cake
	- Demonstrative determiners: this house, those cakes
	- Quantifiers: many houses, any cakes
---

# Constituency

#### From word to sentence:
![[image-12.png]]


---

# Testing for constituency

- constituents are chunks of linguistic material that behave together and are part of one functional unit in the larger syntactic context
- BUT: not always discernable in straightforward way where the boundaries are

-->Diagnostics (tests) available for checking whether chunk has constituent status and where its begins and ends

## Motivation:
Understanding the internal structure of phrases, clauses and sentences:
- Which elements are connected to each other more closely?
- Which elements form a structural unit?

## The five tests:
1. Substitution
2. Deletion
3. Movement
4. Coordination
5. Questioning
Note: Not every test works for every constituent!

---
# 1. Substitution
Many constituents can be substituted with pro-forms:
- pronouns for NP
- do so/that for VP
- then, there, that way for adverbials
![[image-13.png|414x253]]
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"></mark>
# 2. Deletion
Some constituents can be deleted without creating ungrammatical sentences
![[image-14.png|420x272]]

# 3. Movement
Some constituents can be moved to a different place in the sentence without creating ungrammatical sentences
![[image-15.png|433x150]]
<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"></mark><mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"></mark>
# 4. Coordination
Some constituents can be coordinated with a constituent of the same type (see below for coordination)
![[image-16.png|436x318]]<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"></mark>

# 5. Questioning
Some constituents can be tested by forming questions about them
![[image-17.png]]


# Visualising constituency: Tree structures

![[image-18.png]]
### Each node / sub-tree = a constituent

---
# Phrases:

## Chain and choice relationships:

### Syntagmatic: 
- chain relationships, 
- relationship that is sequential, 
- all items need to be at their specific place in chain sequence to have a grammatical sentence

### Paradigmatic:
- choice relationship
- has interchangeability
- different ways of saying similar things —> all different but do similar things 

---

# Phases:
- at the kind of intermediate level between words and clauses
- less complex than clauses
- bigger groups of words around one word class
- defined by word class that informs them

### Many word classes can expand/project into phrases:

| Word Class:        | Phrase Type:              | Examples:                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| N (noun)           | NP (noun phrase)          | ***book***, a ***book***, all my last books, the ***books*** I lost yesterday |
| V (verb)           | VP (verb phrase           | ***buy***, have ***bought***, ***bought*** two books on history               |
| Adj (adjective)    | AdjP (adjective phrase)   | ***cold***, incredibly ***cold***, just a tiny bit ***cold***                 |
| Adv (adverb        | AdvP (adverb phrase)      | ***recently***, very ***recently***                                           |
| Prep (preposition) | PP (prepositional phrase) | ***at*** the airport, ***in*** the bookstore                                  |

## Structure of Phrases:
### Head: (bold elements in examples above)
- obligatory element of phrase 
- determines the kind of phrase (NP, VP…)
### Dependents:
- other elements of phrases (=> pre- and -post modifying elements)

## Endocentric phrases:
- most phrases are these
- can often be replaced entirely by their head in a sentence
- NP, VP, AdjP, AdvP
- e.g. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">The</span> ***<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">books</span>***<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">I</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">lost</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">yesterday</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">may</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">have</span> ***<span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">been</span>*** <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">incredibly</span> ***<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">expensive</span>***. —> ***<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Books</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">are</span> <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">expensive</span>.***

## Exocentric Phrases:
- odd one out
- head connot stand on its own
- PP
- e.g. Books are sold <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">in</span> <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">the</span> <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">bookstore</span>. —> *Books are sold <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">in</span> (is ungrammatical)

---

# Noun Phrases:
![[image-19.png]]
- Pre-modifiers can be quite complex
- Post-modifiers: PPs, Relative clauses, some adjectives (e.g. God almighty)
- in all these phrases “teacher” is the head
#### Special Cases:
- Proper names: Emma, Ms Pilkington
- Pronouns: She, Theirs

## Complex premodifiers:
—> pre-modifier in bold, rest is head

- the ***invitation-only*** audience
- the ***arms-to-Africa*** affair
- ***would-be women*** candidates
- the ***Metropolitan Police’s current March Against Hate*** initiative
- the ***British-is-best*** mentality
- more ***shoot’em and love’em*** epics
- “***thank you if you voted Labour***” advertisements

---


# Verb Phrases:
![[image-20.png]]
•	not all have to be in place —> can only have modal, perfect, progressive, passive
•	HAVE to be in certain word order —> ONLY: modal - perfect - progressive - passive - main verb
•	a lot of pre-modification —> happens through different syntactic verbal slots
#### Note:
•	verb phrases can also take post-modification —> can use PP as a post-modifier
•	read without interruption

---

# Adjective Phrases:
![[image-21.png]]
•	pre-modifiers in particular adverbs
#### Note:
•	Some adjectives take complements (complements are obligatory elements, don’t occur in all constructions, but if they are there they must be=:
      —> adverse to games
•	In contrast to post-modifiers, complements are obligatory elements:
      —> She is adverse to games
      —> *She is adverse


---

# Embedded Phrases:

•	most important aspect: notion that phrases build onto each other and can be embedded into other phrases —> phrases can be embedded into other phrases
•	notion of syntax tree: visualising and understanding syntactic structures
•	each branch is a phrase, and each group branch is also a phrase
![[image-22.png|487x299]]


---

# Immediate constituent analysis - examples:
![[WhatsApp Image 2026-01-10 at 04.50.04.jpeg]]
![[image-23.png|444x364]]

•	Abbreviation triangles: tree is not represented completely
•	“the box on the table in the green room” => complex noun phrase
•	“put” => the head


---


# Clauses: Structural types:

Definition: a constituent with one subject verb structure, it may stand on its own (constituent a sentence by itself)

## Structural types of clauses:
•	zooms in on verb that is part of clauses and the specific shape and form of the verb

### Finite clause:
•	the question of whether the verb is inflected or not, if it is inflected —> it is finite
•	e.g. 
	***Mary*** ***Stays***
    ***Mary*** ***stays*** and ***I’ll stay too*.****

### Non-finite clause:
•	the verb does not carry inflection (but not always; -ed, -ing, …)
•	e.g.
	Someone wants ***Mary*** ***to*** ***stay***.
    ***While*** ***leaving***, I waved goodbye.
    ***Left*** ***by*** ***Mary***, I was sad.

### Verbless clauses:
•	no verb in the clause
•	e.g. Although always helpful


---

# Finite clauses:
a clause containing a finite verb
•	simple sentences, that-clauses / wh-clauses
•	She ***attends*** the classes regularly.

Finite verb:
•	1st or only verb in a VP
•	concord of number and person between subject and verb
•	inflected for verbal categories of person, number, tense
•	e.g. 
	she ***writes***
    she ***lived*** in Paris
 

---

# Non-finite clauses:

•	can’t stand as a sentence on their own
•	always sub-clauses, always need to appear in a more complex clause
•	non-finite clauses might be marked for passive or perfect

a clause whose verb elements are all non-finite
•	no subject — verb agreement / concord
•	no tense-marking, no modal auxiliaries
•	possible forms: -ing / -ed participle, to-inf., gerund, bare inf. (term used to refer to the nonfinite form of a verb)


---

# Verbless clauses:

•	a sub-clause that does not have a verb elements (usually the copula be is omitted)
•	does’nt have a verb elements due to elypse => verb element that could easily be there but is left out for certain reasons
•	e.g. ***Although*** ***always*** ***helpful***, she was not much liked. —> Although <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">she</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">was</span> always helpful, she was not much liked.

# Classifying clauses according to functional role of clause constituents:

Phrases and syntactic function:
•	phrases don’t function as just formal categories —> also have functional properties
•	syntactic function —> task a form preforms in its gramm. context = what does a spec. phrase do in a particular context

Main syntactic functions:
•	Subject (S)
•	Verb (V)
•	Object (O)
•	Complement (C)
•	Adverbial (A)

## Syntactic functions:
![[WhatsApp Image 2026-01-10 at 04.56.32.jpeg]]
- Adverbial = they add additional info, kind of most flexible/moveable of syntactic function

Careful: no 1-1 match between form and function —> can find a certain matching, but can’t always tell

## Objects:
•	constituents complementing a transitive verb —> some verbs are intransitive and do not take an object (e.g. sneeze, die)
•	Objects can be <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">direct</span> and <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">indirect</span>:
I bought <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">my</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">daughter</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">a</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">bike</span>.

## Complements:
•	predicative specifications of subjects and objects the need to be filled for clause to be complete:
She is <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">happy</span>.
She called him <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">an</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">idiot</span>.

## Adverbials:
•	constituents denoting the spatial, temporal and other circumstances
•	often optional —> only obligatory in some constructions:
I have been working <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">all</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">day</span>. —> optional
I put the book <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">on</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">the</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">table</span>. —> obligatory

## Form and function of clause elements:

The happy florist gave him the flower arrangement.
![[WhatsApp Image 2026-01-10 at 05.00.25.jpeg]]
##### •	Form: What structure does the phrase have?
##### •	Function: What role does the phrase fulfil within a clause?

# Clause types: 7 patterns:

#### WORD ORDER IS VERY IMPORTANT IN ENGLISH

•	Only have 7 patterns of clause types —> syntactic function predetermines the ones we have in eng.
•	they do not reflect optional adverbials
•	they are all variations of the SV pattern (Sub. first, then verb) —> eng. is a language with SV pattern

## The 7 pattens of clause types are:

| S       | V    | O      | A         | Cs                 | Co                |
| ------- | ---- | ------ | --------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Subject | Verb | Object | Adverbial | Complement subject | Complement object |

| Pattern:                                                                                                                                    | Example:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

# Sentences and sentence types:

## Simple, complex and compound sentences:

### Simple sentence:
One independent clause:
•	one single gramm. unit with one verbal core
Peter was hungry.

### Compound sentence:
Two or more independent clauses:
•	both parts can stand on their own
•	created by coordination conjunctions; and, or, but, for, so, …
Peter was hungry and he bought a sandwich.

For coordination conjunctions we have a limited set: the FANBOYS set:

| F   | A   | N   | B   | O   | Y   | S   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| for | and | nor | but | or  | yet | so  |


---

## Complex sentence:
(At least) one <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">independent</span> clause and one or more <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">dependent</span> clauses
•	created by use of subordinating conjunctions and relative pronouns; because, since, that, which, if, while …
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Peter</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">ate</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">a</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">sandwich</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)"><b>because</b></span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">he</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">was</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">hungry</span>.
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Peter</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">ate</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">a</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">sandwich</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)"><b>after</b></span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">he</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">came</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">home</span>.

## Coordination:
Two or more units of same type combined into new unit —> usually with coordinating conjunction:
•	The evening <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">and</span> the mornings
•	very cold <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">or</span> moderately humid
•	The evenings have turned very cold recently <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">but</span> the mornings will become colder soon

![[image-24.png|335x265]]

![[image-26.png]]


## Subordination:

A clause is made a constituent of another clause —> usually through subordinating conjunctions 
==> balance is not in equilibrium, one item is more important (independent clause)
•	The evenings have turned very cold <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"><b>since</b></span> we returned from our holidays.

![[image-27.png|525x313]]


## Infinite sentences with a finite set of syntactic rules:

Both coordination and subordination can (in theory) lead to sentences of indefinite length

### Coordination:
•	The evenings will become cold **and** the mornings will become humid **and** the nights will become dark **and** the afternoons will become cloudy **and**…
•	Susan would like to travel to Italy **or** Greece **or** Argentinia **or** South Korea **or** Egypt **or** …

### Subordination:
•	The woman has a cat **which** catches mice that live in the Church **that** is in the centre of the village **that** was named after a mountain **that**…

# Relative clauses: Hinrichs et al. (2015):

Aim and research question: The effect of prescriptivism on (standard) language use:
Do prescriptive language guides have an effect on how people use language? If yes, how can we show this? 

## Restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses:

### Restrictive relative clauses:
•	not separated by comma
•	clause identifies the intended referent:
There are several sandwiches in the fridge. Jenifer takes the sandwich **which is closest to her.**
==> restrictive clause specifically identifies “that” sandwich

•	Restrictive relative clauses with non-human referents can be introduced with which, that or zero relativiser:
      —> the sandwich that is closest to her = prescriptive style guides recommend that —> clear differentiation between restrictive and non-restrictive
      —> the sandwich which is closest to her
      —> the sandwich closest to her

### Non-restrictive relative clauses:
•	separated by comma
•	clause provides additional info. on a referent that was already known before:
Jennifer takes Jack’s sandwich, which has cheese in it.
==> the referent is already identified

•	Non-restrictive relative clauses with non-human referents can only be introduced with which relativiser:
      —> *Jack’s sandwich, that has cheese in it
      —> *Jack’s sandwich, (has) cheese in it

## Results of study:

Increase of that in restrictive relative clauses between 1960s and 1990s
•	decrease of which
•	zero option remains more or less uncharged 

Some evidence for a casual relation between style guide recommendations and change
•	texts that adhere to style guide recommendations overall (espec. with respect to preposition stranding) are more likely to use that instead of which

# Syntactic ambiguities:

#### Adverbials can form adjunctions to different types of phrases:

| They lowered the desk ***from the Victorian period***.                    | They lowered the desk *from the balcony.*                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ***Which desk*** did they lower?<br>—> The one from the Victorian period. | ***How did they lower*** the desk?<br> —> They lowered it from the balcony |
| ***NP adjunction***                                                       | ***VP adjunction***                                                        |
