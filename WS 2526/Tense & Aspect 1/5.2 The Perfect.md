# Tense and Aspect: The Perfect

## Core Definition

The **Perfect** is used in referring to a time **before or up to** a reference time:

| Perfect Type | Reference Time | Used For |
|--------------|----------------|----------|
| **Present perfect** | Present | Time before or up to the present |
| **Past perfect** | Identifiably past time | Time before or up to an identifiably past time |
| **Future perfect** | Purely future time | Time before or up to a purely future time |

**Form:**
- have/has + past participle (Present Perfect)
- had + past participle (Past Perfect)
- will have + past participle (Future Perfect)

---

## 1. Present Perfect or Present Tense?

### Rule: Pre-Present Continuative Situations

If a situation starts at an identifiably past time and continues up to the present, English uses **present perfect**.

These situations have been called: **"pre-present continuative"** situations.

---

### Error Example 1

**Error:**
- *I**'m learning** English for eight years (already).* ❌

**Correction:**
- I **'ve been learning** English for eight years. ✓

**Explanation:**
- Speaker is not talking only about the present
- Speaker is talking specifically about a period of "eight years"
- This period starts at an identifiably past time (eight years ago)
- Continues from then up to the present
- Therefore: **present perfect**, not just present tense, is required

---

## 2. Present Perfect or Past Tense?

### 2.1 Identifiably Past Time → Past Tense

#### Rule
If a situation exists or occurs at an **identifiably past time**, **past tense**, not present perfect, must be used.

**It makes no difference how relevant the situation is to the present.**

---

### Error Example 2

**Error:**
- Why is Sarah using crutches? -- *She**'s had** an accident when she was driving to work.* ❌

**Correction:**
- Why....? -- She **had** an accident when she was driving to work. ✓

**Explanation:**
- The situation of Sarah having an accident occurs at an identifiably past time
- Namely: "when she was driving to work" (specific, identifiable past occasion)
- Therefore: **present perfect is incorrect** and **past tense is required**
- Present relevance (crutches) does not change this

---

### 2.2 Time Before Now NOT Identifiable as Past → Present Perfect

#### 2.2.1 At Any Time Before/Up to Now → Present Perfect

**Rule:** Present perfect is used in referring to situations existing or occurring **"at any time"** before or up to now.

**Example:**
- **Have you seen** Tatort?

**Meaning:**
- Speaker is not referring to a particular episode of Tatort
- Question: Whether addressee now knows Tatort as a result of having seen at least one episode
- Time frame: at any time in your life before now

**Compare:**
- **Did you see** Tatort?
  - Use of past tense only correct if speaker is referring to identifiably past time
  - Would mean: speaker has particular day/period in mind (e.g., last Sunday, when you were in Germany)
  - Assumes hearer knows when speaker is talking about

---

#### 2.2.2 Time Just/Recently Before Now ("News-Giving") → Present Perfect

**Rule:** If a speaker:
- Knows a situation to be past
- BUT assumes the hearer does not know about the situation at all yet
- AND does not specify a past time

Then:
- Situation is not yet identifiable as past for the addressee
- Speaker uses **present perfect**, not past tense

**Example:**
- The President **has been assassinated**.

**Analysis:**
- News announcement
- Speaker knows it's past
- Assumes hearer doesn't know yet
- No specific time given
- Therefore: not yet identifiable as past for hearer

**What Happens Next:**
- As soon as news is given, addressee can identify situation as past
- Further details use past tense:
  - The President **has been assassinated**. He **was shot** at close range with a...

**N.B. Adverb "just":**
- In sense "just before now" in giving news:
  - **British English** and **formal AE**: collocates with **present perfect**
  - **Informal AE**: collocates with **past tense**

**Examples:**
- BE: I **'ve just seen** John. (formal)
- AE informal: I **just saw** John.

## 3. Past Tense or Past Perfect?

### 3.1 Pre-Past Continuative Situations → Past Perfect

#### Rule: Pre-Past Continuative

If a situation starts at an identifiably past time and continues up to **another past time**, English uses **past perfect**.

**Error Example 3:**

**Error:**
- *She **was learning** English for 8 years (already) when she went to university.* ❌

**Correction:**
- She **had been learning** English for 8 years when she went to university. ✓

**Explanation:**
- Speaker is not talking only about time around when she went to university
- The period of eight years starts eight years before the past time (going to university)
- Continues from then up to that past time
- Therefore: **past perfect**, not just past tense, is required

**Parallel to Present Perfect:**
- Present Perfect: past → present
- Past Perfect: past → more recent past

---

### 3.2 Time Before "Then" → Past Perfect

#### Rule
If:
- The contextually relevant time (time speaker/writer and hearer/reader already have in mind) is past
- Speaker/writer then mentions something that happens **before** this

Then:
- **Past perfect** is used to make this pre-past time reference clear

**Example 1:**
- I **asked** John to take the wheel. I **knew** he could drive anything – after all, he **had even driven** a ten-ton truck.

**German:**
- Ich bat John, das Steuer zu übernehmen. Ich wusste, dass er jeden Wagen fahren konnte – schließlich **hatte** er sogar schon einen Zehntonner **gefahren**.

**Analysis:**
- Contextual time: when I asked John
- Driving ten-ton truck happened BEFORE this past time
- Past perfect makes sequence clear

**Example 2:**
- I **got** there at six. Peter **had arrived** an hour earlier.

**German:**
- Ich **kam** um sechs Uhr an. Peter **war** schon eine Stunde früher **eingetroffen**.

**Analysis:**
- Contextual time: when I got there (6:00)
- Peter's arrival happened BEFORE this (5:00)
- Past perfect shows anteriority

---

### 3.3 Identifiably Past Time → Past Tense (Choice Possible)

There are cases where the speaker can choose to view the situation either:
- From point of view of already established past time → **past perfect**
- OR from point of view of present → **past tense** (if identifiably past)

This choice often exists in both English and German.

**Example:**
- John **told** me the whole story yesterday. He **'d heard** about it from Henry himself. / He **heard** about it from Henry himself.

**German:**
- John **hat** mir gestern die ganze Geschichte **erzählt**. Er **hatte** sie von Henry selbst **gehört**. / Er **hat** sie von Henry selbst **gehört**.

**Analysis:**
- Both options are acceptable
- Had heard: viewed from perspective of 'told'
- Heard: viewed from perspective of present

## 4. When German Uses "Plusquamperfekt" But English Doesn't

### 4.1 News Reports

In news reports, English speakers tend to prefer to see situations from the point of view of the present.
- This means English differs from German in cases like the following:

**Example 1:**

**German:**
- ...Drei Stunden vor Konzertbeginn **war** am Pfingstsonntag auf der Thingstätte das bühnenüberspannende Zeltdach **eingestürzt**. Der Konstrukteur aus Hannover **hat** inzwischen die Ursache **bekanntgegeben** und die Verantwortung **übernommen**.

**English:**
- ...Three hours before the concert was due to begin, the canvas roof **collapsed** on Whitsun Sunday at the Thingstätte. The designer from Hanover **has now announced** the cause and **accepted** responsibility.

**Analysis:**
- German: Plusquamperfekt (war eingestürzt) for anteriority
- English: Simple past (collapsed) - viewed from present perspective

**Example 2:**

**German:**
- Kurz nach dem Absturz von Ahmadabad **meldete** die indische Presseagentur PTI ein zweites Flugzeugunglück. Eine "Friendship" der Inlandfluggesellschaft Vayudoot **stürzte** ab. Die zweimotorige Turboprop-Maschine **war** 1958 **gebaut worden**.

**English:**
- Shortly after the Ahmadabad crash, the Indian press agency PTI **reported** a second plane crash. A "Friendship" of the domestic airline Vayudoot **crashed**. The twin-engine turboprop plane **was built** in 1958.

**Analysis:**
- German: war gebaut worden (Plusquamperfekt Passiv)
- English: was built (Simple past)

---

### 4.2 Reminding Hearer of Past Event

German "Plusquamperfekt" is also sometimes used for reminding the hearer of a past event s/he already knows about.

English differs from German here:

**Example:**

**German:**
- A: Kann ich Ihnen helfen?
- B: Ich **hatte** Sie **angerufen** – ich suche Krimis von der Jahrhundertwende.
- A: Ach ja...

**English Options:**
- A: Can I help you?
- B: I **phoned/called/rang** (earlier)... / I'm the person who phoned...
  - NOT: *I had phoned*

**Analysis:**
- German: Plusquamperfekt for reminding
- English: Simple past (viewed from present)

---

## SUMMARY: CHOOSING THE RIGHT PERFECT

### Decision Tree: Present Perfect vs. Past Perfect

```
Reference Time:
│
├─ Present (now) → Use PRESENT PERFECT
│        │
│        ├─ Continuative: I**'ve been learning** for 8 years.
│        ├─ Any time: **Have you seen** Tatort?
│        └─ Recent news: I**'ve bought** a new watch.
│
└─ Past (then) → Use PAST PERFECT
         │
         ├─ Pre-past continuative: I**'d been learning** for 8 years when...
         └─ Before that past time: He**'d arrived** an hour earlier.
```

### Key Differences: Perfect vs. Non-Perfect

| Tense | Time Relation | When Used |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Present** | Now only | Current state/habit |
| **Present Perfect** | Past → Present | Up to now / continuing / recent news |
| **Past** | Identifiably past | Specific past time |
| **Past Perfect** | Past → More recent past | Before a past reference point |
