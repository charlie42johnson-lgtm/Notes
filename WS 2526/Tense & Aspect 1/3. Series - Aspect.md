# Series and Aspect

## Introduction

The principles governing aspect choice for **series** are the same as those governing aspect choice for **singular situations**.

### Key Distinction: Series vs. Individual Instances

A **series** refers to:
- A collection of repeated situations
- The same situation starts, stops, starts, stops
- Occurs a number of times

We refer to these times as the **"individual instances"** of the series.

**For bounded series:** Number of instances is limited
**For unbounded series:** No particular limit to the number of instances

---

## Two Levels of Talking About Series

Speakers can talk about a series of situations on **two distinct levels**:

### Level 1: The Series as a Series
Talking about the series as a whole collection.

**Examples:**
- She read a lot of Dickens last semester. (bounded series)
- She read anything and everything. (unbounded series)

### Level 2: Individual Instances
Talking about the individual occurrences that make up the series.

**Examples:**
- Whenever I see them, they shout at me. (each instance complete)
- Whenever I see them, they're shouting at someone. (each instance in progress)

### Key Point
- A **series** can be bounded or unbounded
- **Individual instances** are always bounded

---

## BOUNDEDNESS IN SERIES

### Bounded Series
A series with a limited number of instances.

**Example 1 - Bounded Series:**
- She read a lot of Dickens last semester.
  - Limited time period: last semester
  - Limited number of reading events

**Example 2 - Bounded Series:**
- I met him at the big Pride parade last semester.
  - Specific occasion within bounded time

### Unbounded Series
A series with no particular limit to the number of instances.

**Example 1 - Unbounded Series:**
- She was very well read. She read anything and everything.
  - No time limits mentioned
  - Open-ended series

**Example 2 - Unbounded Series:**
- The planet Zog orbited two suns, and clouds of tririllium dust swirled around its surface.
  - Fictional/narrative context - no inherent limits

---

## ASPECT CHOICE FOR SERIES

### SIMPLE ASPECT - When Used

Simple is used for:

#### 1. Unbounded Series with No Focus on Individual Instances

**Examples:**
- She **reads** a lot.
- She **was** very well read. She **read** anything and everything.

#### 2. Unbounded Series with Each Instance in Its Entirety

**Examples:**
- She **cycles** to uni.
- She **was** very active. She always **walked** or **cycled** to uni, for example.
  - Each instance = every day she has/had classes
  - Each complete instance seen in its entirety

#### 3. Bounded Series Seen in Its Entirety

**Example:**
- She **cycled** to uni all last semester.
  - Entire bounded series viewed as complete whole

#### 4. Individual Instances in Their Entirety (Bounded or Unbounded Series)

**Examples:**
- They **shout** at me when they see me.
- They always/usually/sometimes/etc. **shout** at me when they see me.
- Whenever they see me, they **shout** at me.
  - Each instance seen as complete occurrence
  - **'Always'** has normal meaning of "every time" here

**More Complex Example:**
- [She cycles to uni. / She's cycling to uni this semester.] She **goes** under the railway at Messplatz, **cycles** through the allotments and on to Weststadt/Südstadt, and then she **takes** the path by the railway line to the Old Town.
  - Series of actions each seen in its entirety
  - Simple aspect throughout

---

### PROGRESSIVE ASPECT - When Used

Progressive is used for:

#### 1. Establishing Bounded Series as In Progress (Started but Not Finished)

**Examples:**
- She **'s cycling** to uni this semester.
  - Establishes: bounded (this semester) + in progress
  - Series started, not yet finished

- My brother came to stay with me last November. I **was cycling** to uni that semester, so I gave him my car to use.
  - Past reference: bounded series in progress in past

#### 2. Individual Instances as In Progress (Bounded or Unbounded Series)

**Examples:**
- Whenever I see them, they **'re shouting** at someone.
- They **'re always/often/usually** shouting at someone when I see them.
  - Each instance seen as having started but not finished
  - **'Always'** has normal meaning of "every time" here

**More Complex Example:**
- [She cycles to uni. / She's cycling to uni this semester.] I often see her when she **'s speeding** through the allotments between Kirchheim and Südstadt.
  - Individual instance in progress when observed

---

## ADDITIONAL USES OF PROGRESSIVE

### 1. "Frequently but Sporadically" Meaning

#### Special Use of Always + Progressive
There's an additional use of **'always' + Progressive** beyond the normal use:

**Normal use:** Individual instances have already started and not yet finished whenever...

**Additional use:** 
- Sense: situation is **characteristic behavior** of the subject
- Could find the subject doing this behavior at any time
- No "whenever" sense
- German: ständig, dauernd, immer wieder

**Examples:**
- He **'s so attentive**. He **'s always bringing** me flowers.
- They **'re really hard to please**. They **'re always complaining**.

**Key Differences:**

| Normal Use | Special Use |
|------------|-------------|
| Linked to specific occasions | Not linked to specific occasions |
| "Whenever X, Y is in progress" | "At any time, Y might be in progress" |
| Predictable timing | Unpredictable timing |
| German: immer wenn | German: ständig/dauernd |

---

### 2. Identity of Reference with Series

#### Rule
The "identity of reference" use of Progressive can be used for **series** as well as for singular situations.

**Meaning:** 'when X occurs, what is actually going on is Y'

**Example:**
- They **go** to the opera at least once a month. They **'re not** really opera fans, though. They **'re just trying** to impress the neighbours.
  - Going to opera = trying to impress neighbors
  - The series of opera visits is interpreted as the series of attempts

**Contrast with Simple:**
- They **go** to the opera... and they **try** to impress the neighbors.
  - Would mean two separate series of actions

## COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLES WITH ANALYSIS

### Example 1: Bounded Series - Simple

**Sentence:**
- She **read** a lot of Dickens last semester.

**Analysis:**
- **Series type:** Bounded (limited time: last semester)
- **Focus:** Series as a whole
- **Aspect:** Simple
- **Reason:** Viewing the entire bounded series as complete

---

### Example 2: Bounded Series - Progressive

**Sentence:**
- She **'s cycling** to uni this semester.

**Analysis:**
- **Series type:** Bounded (this semester)
- **Focus:** Series in progress
- **Aspect:** Progressive
- **Reason:** Establishing that bounded series has started but not finished

---

### Example 3: Unbounded Series - Simple

**Sentence:**
- She **reads** a lot.

**Analysis:**
- **Series type:** Unbounded (no limits)
- **Focus:** Series as general characteristic
- **Aspect:** Simple
- **Reason:** No specific temporal boundaries

---

### Example 4: Individual Instances - Simple

**Sentence:**
- Whenever they see me, they **shout** at me.

**Analysis:**
- **Focus:** Individual instances
- **View of instances:** Each occurs in its entirety
- **Aspect:** Simple
- **Reason:** Each shouting event seen as complete occurrence

---

### Example 5: Individual Instances - Progressive

**Sentence:**
- Whenever I see them, they **'re shouting** at someone.

**Analysis:**
- **Focus:** Individual instances
- **View of instances:** Each has started but not finished
- **Aspect:** Progressive
- **Reason:** Each shouting event seen as in progress when observed

---

### Example 6: Always + Progressive (Normal Use)

**Sentence:**
- Mrs. Sagei **'s always sitting** at her window watching the passers-by when I pass her house.

**Analysis:**
- **Focus:** Individual instances
- **Always meaning:** Every time (whenever I pass)
- **Aspect:** Progressive
- **Reason:** Each instance in progress on each occasion

---

### Example 7: Always + Progressive (Sporadic Use)

**Sentence:**
- He **'s always bringing** me flowers.

**Analysis:**
- **Focus:** Characteristic behavior
- **Always meaning:** Frequently but sporadically (not every time)
- **Aspect:** Progressive
- **Reason:** Unpredictable occurrence of characteristic behavior
- **German:** Er bringt mir ständig Blumen.

---

### Example 8: Complex Series with Different Aspects

**Sentence:**
- I **'m feeding** their goldfish every day while they are on holiday. I **take** them their newspaper and milk every day until they came back from Paris.

**Analysis:**
- **First clause:** Progressive - establishes bounded series in progress
- **Second clause:** Simple - each instance seen in its entirety within established frame
- **Temporal frame:** 'while they are on holiday' / 'until they came back'
- **Pattern:** Progressive establishes temporary series → Simple for complete actions within that series

---

### Example 9: Identity of Reference with Series

**Sentence:**
- They **go** to the opera at least once a month. They **'re not** really opera fans, though. They **'re just trying** to impress the neighbours.

**Analysis:**
- **First sentence:** Series described (Simple)
- **Interpretation:** Progressive required
- **Meaning:** The series of opera-going = the series of trying to impress
- **Identity of reference:** What they're really doing is trying to impress

**Contrast with separate actions:**
- They go to the opera... and they try to impress... (would mean two separate series)

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER

1. **Same aspect rules** apply to series as to singular situations

2. **Two levels** of talking about series:
   - Series as a whole
   - Individual instances

3. **Boundedness**:
   - Series can be bounded or unbounded
   - Individual instances are always bounded

4. **Aspect choice depends on**:
   - Whether series/instances are seen in entirety or in progress
   - Whether series is bounded or unbounded
   - Speaker's focus and communicative purpose

5. **Always + Progressive** has two uses:
   - Normal: every time (whenever...)
   - Special: frequently but sporadically (characteristic behavior)

6. **Identity of reference** works with series too:
   - Progressive for interpretive sentence
   - 'What they're actually doing is...'

7. **German equivalents**:
   - Always (normal) = immer wenn
   - Always (sporadic) = ständig/dauernd/immer wieder
