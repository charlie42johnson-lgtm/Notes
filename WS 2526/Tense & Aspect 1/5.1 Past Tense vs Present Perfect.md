# Past Tense vs. Present Perfect

## A. General Principle

### The Core Distinction: Identifiably Past vs. Pre-Present

| Tense               | Time Type                  | Definition                                                                                                       | Key Characteristic                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Past Tense**      | **Identifiably past** time | Time within or throughout a time span which is known by both speaker and hearer to end before the present moment | The hearer knows it's past because:<br>• Speaker tells in some way<br>• Hearer already has relevant knowledge                                                       |
| **Present Perfect** | **Pre-present** time       | Time within or throughout a time span that is seen as continuing up to the present moment                        | Time is seen this way because:<br>• Period up to present is specified<br>• Sense is "at any time before now"<br>• Sense is "recently before now" (no specific time) |

**Alternative Terminology:**
- "Identifiably past" = "definite past" (many other grammars)
- "Pre-present" = "indefinite past" + "from past to present" (many other grammars)

---

## B. Past Tense, NOT Present Perfect - Usage Cases

Past tense is used when the time referred to is "identifiably past".

### 1. Past Time Narrative

**Example:**
- Clara Velde, to begin with what was conspicuous about her, **had short blond hair**,… (first sentence in Saul Bellow, A Theft)

**Why Past Tense:**
- Narrative begins in identifiable past time
- Story is located in past

---

### 2. Past Time Specified in Adverbial

**Examples:**
- last week
- yesterday
- five minutes ago
- in 1999
- when I was young

**N.B. Adverbials like this week and today:**
These also specify past time if they mean "in an earlier part of" this week/today.

**Compare:**
- I **saw** five patients today. (past: earlier today / when I was at work today)
- I **'ve seen** five patients today. (pre-present: so far today / five patients so far)

**Key Difference:**
- **Saw** = time span (today) known to end before present (work day ended)
- **Have seen** = time span (today) continuing up to present (still today, may see more)

---

### 3. Subject Makes Past Time Clear

The subject specifies:
- A time which does not continue up to now, OR
- A person, thing or place which no longer exists

**Examples:**
- The nineteenth century **was** a time of great upheaval in…
- Shakespeare **led** an active life…
- My late grandmother **lived** in that house.

**N.B. Important Exception:**
The subject may name a past time or dead person WITHOUT the sentence necessarily referring to past time.

**Examples:**
- The nineteenth century **has had** a great influence on me.
  - Time reference: in my life up to now
  - Subject: my study/knowledge of the nineteenth century (still exists)
  
- Shakespeare **has been taught** in British schools for generations.
  - Time reference: for generations up to now
  - Subject: Shakespeare's works (still exist) / Shakespeare's life as subject of study

**Why Present Perfect Here:**
- The influence/teaching continues up to present
- The works/subject still exist now

---

### 4. Adverbial of Place Makes Past Time Clear

If an adverbial specifies a place at which the situation occurred/existed at one particular time when...

**Example:**
- I **saw** Silke at the theatre.
  - Implied: when I was at the theatre last night/week/before I came here/etc.
  - Specific past occasion identifiable from place

**Compare with Present Perfect:**
- I **'ve often seen** Silke at the theatre.
  - Meaning: at the times I have been to the theatre up to now
  - No specific past occasion - series up to present

---

### 5. Both Speaker and Hearer Know When

Both know when before now the situation occurred/existed.

**Example:**
- I'm sorry – I **didn't catch** that. Could you say it again?
  - Past time: a few seconds ago, when you said something
  - Identifiable to both: the utterance that just happened

---

### 6. Speaker Assumes Hearer Knows Past Time

The speaker assumes that the hearer knows there is reference to a past time.

**Example:**
- **Did you see** Titanic?
  - Past time identifiable as:
    - last night (when it was on TV)
    - when you were in the States
    - after you mentioned you might go
    - etc.

**Compare with Present Perfect:**
- **Have you seen** Titanic? (see Case C2 below)
  - At any time before now
  - No specific occasion intended

---

### 7. Speaker Gives/Asks for Details of How Something Came into Existence

The speaker assumes hearer already knows a situation/thing/person/place exists.
- Speaker gives/asks for details of how it came into existence.

**Examples:**
- **Who wrote** Middlemarch?
  - Assumes: Middlemarch exists
  - Asks: who brought it into existence (past action)

- I **was born** with red hair.
  - Assumes: I exist with red hair
  - States: how this came about (past event)

**Why Not Present Perfect:**
- The existence is presupposed, not new information
- Focus is on the past creative act

---

## C. Present Perfect, NOT Past Tense - Usage Cases

Present perfect is used when the time referred to is a "pre-present" time.

### 1. Situation Starts in Past and Continues to Present

**"Pre-present continuative"** situations

**Example:**
- I **'ve been learning** English for eight years.

**Why Present Perfect:**
- Situation starts at identifiably past time (8 years ago)
- Continues from then up to the present
- Not talking only about present
- Talking specifically about period that includes past-to-present

**Error Example:**
- *I**'m learning** English for eight years (already).* ❌
- **Correction:** I **'ve been learning** English for eight years. ✓

---

### 2. Situation Happens at Any Time Before/Up to Now

Present perfect is used when referring to situations existing or occurring "at any time" before or up to now.

**Example:**
- **Have you seen** "Titanic"?

**Meaning:**
- Not referring to a particular episode or showing
- Question: Do you now know Titanic as a result of having seen at least one episode?
- Time frame: at any time before now in your life

**Compare with Past Tense:**
- **Did you see** Titanic?
  - Only correct if referring to identifiably past time
  - Speaker has particular day/period in mind
  - Assumes hearer knows when speaker is talking about

**More Examples:**
- I **'ve read** that book. (at some point before now)
- She **has visited** Paris several times. (at various times up to now)
- **Have you ever met** my brother? (at any time in your life)

---

### 3. Situation Happens Recently Before Now ("News-Giving")

If a speaker:
- Knows a situation to be past
- BUT assumes the hearer does not know about it yet
- AND does not specify a past time

Then:
- Situation is not yet identifiable as past for the addressee
- Speaker uses **present perfect**, not past tense

**Example:**
- The President **has been assassinated**.
  - News announcement
  - Speaker knows it's past
  - Assumes hearer doesn't know yet
  - No specific time given

**What Happens Next:**
- As soon as news is given, addressee can identify situation as past
- Further details use past tense:
  - The President **has been assassinated**. He **was shot** at close range with a...

**N.B. Adverb "just":**
- In sense "just before now" in giving news:
  - **British English** and **formal AE**: collocates with **present perfect**
  - **Informal AE**: collocates with **past tense**

**Examples:**
- BE: I **'ve just seen** John. (formal)
- AE informal: I **just saw** John.

## D. The Question of Present Relevance

### Common Misconception

It is true that if the present perfect is used, the situation referred to has relevance for the present. This is why "present relevance" crops up in academic descriptions.

**BUT:** This is **NOT helpful for learners** choosing between past tense and present perfect.

### Why "Present Relevance" Fails Learners

#### 1. Both Tenses Can Express Present Relevance

Both present perfect and past tense are used in talking about situations that have present relevance.

**Example:**
- Why is Sarah using crutches? -- She **had** an accident when she was driving to work.
  - Accident has clear present relevance: crutches
  - But past tense is correct because time is identifiably past

#### 2. Learners' Starting Point

Descriptive linguists:
- Start with native-speaker usage
- Describe what they find

Learners:
- Do NOT have native-speaker usage as starting point
- Need **instructions** on what tense to choose
- "Present relevance" gives no actionable guidance

#### 3. Worse Than Useless

For students below a certain (very advanced) level, "present relevance" will:
- **Not help** them choose correctly
- **Encourage** them to get it wrong

**Typical Error:**
- *Why is Sarah using crutches? -- *She**'s had** an accident when she was driving to work.* ❌

**Correction:**
- Why is Sarah using crutches? -- She **had** an accident when she was driving to work. ✓

**The Problem:**
- Student sees present relevance (crutches)
- Student uses present perfect (wrong)
- Student needs to learn: time is identifiably past (when she was driving)

### What Teachers Should Do

If you are describing the present perfect for non-native learners:
- Your description needs to meet their needs
- Give them clear decision criteria (A, B, C above)
- Don't rely on "present relevance"
- Focus on: identifiably past vs. pre-present time

---

## DECISION FLOWCHART

```
Is the time identifiably past?
│
├─ YES → Use PAST TENSE
│        (even if there's present relevance)
│
└─ NO → Is it pre-present time?
         │
         ├─ YES → Use PRESENT PERFECT
         │        (continuing, any time, or recent news)
         │
         └─ NO → Different tense needed
                  (Present, Future, etc.)
```

## PRACTICE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Identifiably Past

**Context:** Yesterday, I drove to work. While I was driving, I had an accident.

**Question:** Why is Sarah using crutches?

**Answer:** She **had** an accident when she was driving to work.

**Why:**
- Time is identifiably past (when she was driving to work)
- Past tense required despite present relevance

---

### Example 2: Pre-Present (Continuative)

**Context:** I started learning English 8 years ago. I am still learning it.

**Sentence:** I **'ve been learning** English for eight years.

**Why:**
- Situation starts in past, continues to present
- Pre-present continuative

---

### Example 3: Pre-Present (Any Time)

**Context:** At some point in your life, you saw the movie Titanic.

**Question:** **Have you seen** Titanic?

**Why:**
- Asking about any time before now
- No specific occasion intended
- Present perfect required

**Compare:**
- **Did you see** Titanic [when it was on TV last night]?
  - Specific, identifiable past time
  - Past tense required

---

### Example 4: Pre-Present (Recent News)

**Context:** I just found out something that you don't know yet.

**Announcement:** I **'ve bought** a new watch!

**Follow-up:** I **paid** for it with my girlfriend's credit card.

**Why:**
- First sentence: news-giving (hearer doesn't know)
- Present perfect required
- Second sentence: details about now-known situation
- Past tense acceptable

---

### Example 5: Adverbial Determines

**Context:** It's 11 a.m. I'm talking about my morning.

**Past:** I **saw** Terry this morning.
  - 'This morning' + Preterite = past part of time-span

**Present Perfect:** I **haven't seen** him today.
  - 'Today' + Present Perfect = up to now

---

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Past Tense** = identifiably past time (definite past)
2. **Present Perfect** = pre-present time (indefinite past / past-to-present)
3. **Time, not relevance**, determines the choice
4. Both tenses can express present relevance
5. **Identifiably past** = hearer can identify the specific past time
6. **Pre-present** = time span continuing up to present
7. **Don't teach "present relevance"** as primary criterion
8. **Teach the decision criteria** clearly (A, B, C)
