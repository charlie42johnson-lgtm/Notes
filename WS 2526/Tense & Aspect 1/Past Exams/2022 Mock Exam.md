# Part A:

#### 1)    Name the tense and aspect for situations 1, 2, 4, 15, 25, 26 and 27.

| Situation: | Tense and Aspect:      |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| 1          | past simple            |
| 2          | past simple            |
| 4          | present perfect simple |
| 15         | past perfect simple    |
| 25         | past progressive       |
| 26         | present progressive    |
| 27         | present simple         |

#### 2)    Provide six examples, from 1-30, of stative situations.

1, 3, 14, 16, 27, 28


#### 3)    Provide six examples, from 1-30, of singular dynamic situations that occur in their entirety at an identifiably past time.

2, 11, 12, 19, 20, 23


#### 4)    What is the time reference of situations 4-8?

The time reference during Reginald's life up to now

#### 5)    What are the different future meanings in 18, 29 and 30?

18: past intention of the lynchers (intention of the lynchers to lynch speaker)
29: prediction focusing on a purely future time based on the speaker's previous experience of failure
30: predictions based on present signs (dentist's knowledge of this procedure)

#### 6)    Why would "I encouraged" not work in 15?

It would not work as encouraging the name changing happens at a pre-past time, before the past time that has already been set at this point.

#### 7)    Explain the choice of aspect in number 21.

The aspect is simple as it is an unbounded series where each individual instance occurs in it's entirety.

#### 8)    What is the time relationship between situation 22 and situation 23?

The time relationship is that they are successive events, first 22 happens then 23 happens.

#### 9)    What is the time relationship between situation 24 and situation 25?

The time relationship is that 25 had already started and not yet finished when 24 occurs.

# Part C:

1. 
Error: She was always having
Correction: She always had

The situation of her always having breakfast here is an unbounded series where each individual instance of her having breakfast is seen as occurring in its entirety every Saturday. Progressive is incorrect. We need simple.

2. 
Error: She has never seen
Correction: She had never seen

The situation of her never having seen the ocean is pre-past as the speaker already establishes a past time in the story and this situation happens before then, it is "time before then". Present perfect is incorrect, we need past perfect.

3. 
Error: she played
Correction: she was playing

The situation of the girlfriend playing dumb is an instance of identity of reference as when she threw her hands up, what was really going on was that she was playing dumb. Therefore simple is incorrect, we need progressive.

4. 
Error: Girls were being rude
Correction: girls were rude

The situation of girls being rude is stative, not dynamic. The sense is the property of rudeness being ascribed to the girls. Therefore progressive is incorrect. We need simple.

5. 
Error: The woman was putting on
Correction: The woman put on

The situation of the woman putting on sunglasses is seen as occurring in its entirety, not as having already started and not yet finished, when moving to the next stall. Progressive is incorrect, we need simple.

6. 
Error: The woman had tried it on
Correction: The woman tried it on

The situation of the woman trying it on is identifiably past, the identifiable past time is when "the trader passed it across to her". For identifiably past situations past perfect is incorrect, we need past tense.

7. 
Error: You leave without paying
Correction: You're leaving without paying

The situation of you leaving without paying is seen as having already started and not yet finished, not as occurring in its entirety, when the waitress accuses you. Therefore simple is incorrect, progressive is needed.

8. 
Error: I have just been trying
Correction: I was just trying to

The situation of me just trying to stop the person is identifiably past, the identifiable past time is when "you stopped me". For identifiably past situations present perfect is incorrect, we need past tense.

9. 
Error: I bring it
Correction: I'll bring it

The situation of me bringing it when I'm ready is a spontaneous decision in reaction to you telling me to bring the bill. For spontaneous decisions present simple is incorrect, we need will + infinitive.

10. 
Error: They had obviously fought
Correction: The had obviously been fighting

The situation of the children fighting is seen as having a result/effect, that being cuts on their foreheads. Here the effect is caused by the activity of fighting, not whether is is complete is not. In past situations where completion is irrelevant simple is incorrect, we need progressive.
