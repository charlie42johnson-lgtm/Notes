# Tense and Aspect: Future Time

## Overview

English has **no future tense**. Instead, future time is expressed using various forms with different meanings.

This handout covers future time expressions for **dynamic situations** and **states**.

---

## 1. DYNAMIC SITUATIONS

For dynamic situations (actions, events, processes), there are several ways to express future time.

---

### A. PERSONAL ARRANGEMENTS OR PLANS: Present Progressive

#### Form
**am/is/are + -ing**

#### Sense / Meaning
- X has planned to…
- X has arranged to…
- There are plans/arrangements for X to…

**Key Feature:** The event has been **personally arranged** or **planned**.

#### Example
- Sorry, we **can't make it** this afternoon. We **'re taking** the kids to the zoo.
  - **Meaning:** We have arranged/planned to take the kids
  - **Evidence:** Plans exist, probably discussed/decided earlier

#### When to Use
1. **Personal arrangements** (you made the arrangements)
2. **Specific plans** (details decided)
3. **Preparations exist** (tickets bought, reservations made)

#### Common Contexts
- Social arrangements: "We're having dinner with friends tonight."
- Travel plans: "I'm flying to Berlin tomorrow."
- Appointments: "She's seeing the dentist at 3."

**Not for:**
- General intentions (use "be going to")
- Timetables (use present simple)
- Predictions (use "will")

---

### B. SCHEDULED ARRANGEMENTS: Present Simple (or Present Progressive)

#### Form
**Present Simple:** base form (+s for 3rd person)

#### Sense / Meaning
- A time (day/date/etc.) has been officially/externally fixed for X to…

**Key Feature:** The event is on a **public schedule** or **official timetable**.

#### Examples - Present Simple
- **When does the bus leave?**
- The film **starts** at eight.
- The train **arrives** at 10:15.
- The museum **opens** at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

#### Examples - Present Progressive (Informal)
In informal style, progressive is often used for scheduled events:
- The film**'s starting** at eight.
- **When is the bus leaving?**

**Note:** Both are correct; progressive is more casual.

#### When to Use Present Simple
1. **Public transport timetables**
2. **Cinema/theatre schedules**
3. **Official programs**
4. **Fixed opening hours**
5. **Calendar events**

**Difference from Personal Arrangements:**
- **Personal arrangements:** You or someone specific made the arrangement
- **Scheduled events:** Part of a public/official schedule

---

### C. INTENTIONS: be going to + infinitive

#### Form
**am/is/are going to + base verb**

#### Sense / Meaning

#### When to Use
1. **Intentions** (you've decided)

In reaction to something that has just happened or just been said, the speaker:
- **promises** to…

## SUMMARY: DYNAMIC FUTURE FORMS

| Form | Meaning | Key Feature | Example |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Present Progressive** | Personal arrangements | You made plans | We're taking the kids to the zoo. |
| **Present Simple** | Scheduled/timetable | Public schedule | The train leaves at 6:30. |

## 2. STATES

### Rule
In talking about **future states**, the progressive is – obviously – **not possible**.

### Available Forms

For future states, it is normally possible to use:

#### 1. will + simple infinitive (for all meanings)

**Examples:**
- Sorry, I **can't make it** this afternoon. I **'ll be** at the zoo.
  - **Future state:** being at the zoo
  - **Meaning:** certain future fact

- I **'ll know** the results tomorrow.
  - **Future state:** knowing

#### 2. present simple (for officially scheduled arrangements)

**Example:**
- The exhibition **opens** next week.
  - **Future state:** being open
  - **Scheduled:** official arrangement

#### 3. be going to + simple infinitive

**Examples:**
- **Present intentions:** I **'m going to be** a doctor. (decided)
- **Predictions from signs:** Look at those clouds! It **'s going to be** a stormy night.
  - **Present evidence:** clouds

---

### Summary Table: Future States

| Form | When Used | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **will + be** | Certain future fact | I'll be at the zoo. |
| **will + other stative** | Future knowledge/state | I'll know tomorrow. |
| **present simple** | Scheduled state | The exhibition opens next week. |
| **be going to + be** | Intention/prediction | I'm going to be late. |

---

## 3. ADVERBIAL CLAUSES OF TIME

### Rule
**None of the above applies** in a temporal clause with future time reference.

In these clauses:
- There should be **no indication of purely future time** on the verb
- This means **purely future will is never used**

### Examples

**Correct:**
- I**'ll see you** when I **see you**.
  - Temporal clause: "when I see you" → present simple
  - Main clause: "I'll see you" → will

- I**'m coming** back tomorrow – I**'ll call** you as soon as I **get home**.
  - Temporal clause: "as soon as I get home" → present simple
  - Main clauses: progressive and will

**Incorrect:**
- *I**'ll call** you as soon as I **will get** home.* ❌

### Why This Rule Exists

The future meaning is carried by:
- The main clause, OR
- The temporal adverbial itself

The temporal clause expresses:
- A **time relationship**, not
- A **future prediction**

### Common Temporal Conjunctions

| Conjunction | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **when** | I'll tell you when I see you. |
| **as soon as** | I'll call as soon as I get home. |
| **before** | Finish this before you leave. |
| **after** | We'll go out after we eat. |
| **until** | Wait here until I return. |
| **once** | Once you finish, we can go. |

**Note:** Some of these can also be used with present perfect:
- "I'll call you when I've finished."
- "We'll go out after we've eaten."

---

## SPECIAL USES OF PROGRESSIVE

### 1. Always + Progressive

**Meaning:** Frequently but sporadically (characteristic behavior)

**Example:**
- He **'s always leaving** the lights on.
  - Not every time, but characteristically

---

### 2. Identity of Reference

**Meaning:** 'when X occurs, what is actually going on is Y'

**Example:**
- They **go** to the opera, but they **'re just trying** to impress the neighbors.

---

### 3. Special Use with Verbs of Saying in the Past

**Meaning:** 'there was a chat/conversation'

**Example:**
- I **was talking** to John yesterday about the project.
  - Implies: there was a conversation (not necessarily finished)

---

### 4. Progressive with Perfect

**Meaning:** Before/up to now, completion not important

**Example:**
- I **'ve been working** all day. (tired now)

---

### 5. Indirect Assumptions: will + progressive

**Meaning:** Assumption based on expectation/normality

**Example:**
- She **'ll be travelling** first class. (I know her)

**Note:** This is **not** prediction from present signs.
It is assumption based on what is **expected/normal** for her.

```
Dynamic or State?
│
├─ DYNAMIC → What is the source?
│        │
│        ├─ Personal arrangement/plan → Present Progressive
│        │        (We're taking the kids to the zoo.)
│        │
│        ├─ Official schedule/timetable → Present Simple
│        │        (The train leaves at 6:30.)
│        │
│        ├─ Intention/decision exists → be going to
│        │        (I'm going to call the police.)
│        │
│        ├─ Spontaneous decision → will
│        │        (I'll get it!)
│        │
│        ├─ Prediction from present evidence → be going to
│        │        (It's going to rain. - look at clouds)
│        │
│        ├─ Pure future prediction → will
│        │        (It will rain tomorrow.)
│        │
│        └─ Assumption about normal/expected → will + progressive
│                 (She'll be travelling first class.)
│
└─ STATE → Use:
         • will + be (certain future)

## PRACTICE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Personal Arrangement

**Context:** You and your friend planned yesterday to go to the cinema.

**You:** We **'re seeing** a film tonight.

**Why:** Personal arrangement exists (planned yesterday)

---

### Example 2: Timetable

**Context:** Checking the train schedule.

**You:** What time **does the train leave**?

**Why:** Public timetable

---

### Example 3: Intention

**Context:** You've decided to quit your job.

**You:** I **'m going to resign** next month.

**Why:** Intention exists (decision made)

---

### Example 4: Spontaneous Decision

**Context:** Phone rings. No one else moves.

**You:** I **'ll get it**!

**Why:** Just decided at this moment

---

### Example 5: Prediction from Evidence

**Context:** Dark clouds gathering.

**You:** It **'s going to rain** soon.

**Why:** Present evidence (clouds)

---

### Example 6: Pure Prediction

**Context:** Talking about tomorrow's weather forecast.

**You:** It **'ll rain** tomorrow.

**Why:** Future focus, no present evidence mentioned

---

### Example 7: Indirect Assumption

**Context:** Talking about your wealthy aunt's travel habits.

**You:** She **'ll be staying** at the Ritz.

**Why:** Assumption based on what she normally does

---

### Example 8: Future State

**Context:** Tomorrow afternoon.

**You:** I **'ll be** in a meeting.

**Why:** Future state → will + be

---

### Example 9: Temporal Clause

**Context:** Making plans.

**You:** I **'ll call** you when I **get** home.

**Why:** Temporal clause → present simple (not "will get")

---

## COMMON ERRORS

### Error 1: Using will in temporal clauses

**Wrong:** *I**'ll call** you when I **will get** home.* ❌

**Correct:** I**'ll call** you when I **get** home. ✓

---

### Error 2: Using simple present for personal arrangements

**Wrong:** *We **take** the kids to the zoo this afternoon.* (without context)

**Better:** We**'re taking** the kids to the zoo this afternoon. ✓

**Unless:** It's a **timetable** event (e.g., "The zoo tour starts at 3.")

---

### Error 3: Confusing intention with spontaneous decision

**Wrong:** *I **will** study medicine.* (if already decided)

**Better:** I**'m going to study** medicine. ✓

**Unless:** Just decided now (e.g., doctor asks your major, you decide on the spot)

---

### Error 4: Using progressive for future states

**Wrong:** *I **'m being** tired tomorrow.* ❌

**Correct:** I**'ll be** tired tomorrow. ✓

**Why:** State → no progressive

---

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **English has no future tense** - uses various forms
2. **Present Progressive** = personal arrangements
3. **Present Simple** = scheduled/timetable events
4. **be going to** = intentions / predictions from evidence
5. **will** = spontaneous decisions / pure predictions
6. **will + progressive** = assumptions about normal/expected
7. **Temporal clauses** → no "will" (use present)
8. **States** → no progressive (obviously)
9. **Choice depends on:** source of future (arrangement, intention, evidence, assumption)
10. **Ask:** What kind of future reference? Personal plan? Schedule? Intention? Spontaneous decision? Prediction?

---
