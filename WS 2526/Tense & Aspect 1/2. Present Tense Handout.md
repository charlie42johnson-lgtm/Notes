# The Present Tense

## 1. TENSE

### Definition
The **Present tense** is used when the speaker sees the situation referred to as:
- Located **at the time of speaking 'now'** (= the speaker's zero point)
- Or **including it**

---

## 2. THE PRESENT TENSE AND ASPECT

### General Rules
The general rules for the interaction of situation types and aspect are described in "Basic Concepts and Terms".

### Reference System
- **B** = References to paragraphs in "Basic Concepts and Terms" (e.g., B 2.2)
- **P** = References to paragraphs in "The Present Tense" (e.g., P 2.1)

---

### 2.1 STATIVE SITUATIONS

#### Rule
**Simple aspect is used** for stative situations.

#### Examples
- You **'ll like** him. He **'s** intelligent, warm-hearted and generous. (B 2.2 - property ascription)
- My girlfriend **thinks** I should take the job. (B 2.2 - mental state)
- These leaflets **are printed** on recycled paper. (B 7 - stative passive)
- He **teaches**, I think. (B 8 - 'He's a teacher')
- This jam **tastes** weird. (B 8 - perception verb, stative sense)

#### Contrasting Dynamic Examples (Progressive)
- The local dramatic society **'s being** very generous. (dynamic - deliberate behavior)
- She **'s thinking** of taking a job in Northumberland. (dynamic - mental process)
- The leaflets **are being printed** today. (dynamic passive)
- I **'m afraid** you can't see him till 10.15. He **'s teaching** at the moment. (dynamic activity)
- I **'m not eating** it – I **'m only tasting** it. (dynamic action)

---

### 2.2 INHERENTLY AND TEMPORALLY BOUNDED SITUATIONS: PROGRESSIVE ASPECT

#### Rule
Such situations are chiefly seen as **in progress in relation to 'now'**:
- Having started and not yet finished at the time of speaking
- In this case, **Progressive aspect is used**

#### Examples
- Tim **'s sewing** my button on. It won't take much longer. (inherently bounded)
- The freezer **'s making** a funny noise. (temporally bounded)
- I **'m looking after** the children while their mother **'s** at the dentist. (temporarily bounded)
- Sal **'s making** three new bookcases for me. The first one's finished already. (bounded series in progress)

---

### 2.3 INHERENTLY AND TEMPORALLY BOUNDED SITUATIONS: SIMPLE ASPECT

#### Rule
In some cases, a situation may be seen as occurring **in its entirety at the time of speaking**.
- Therefore, **Simple aspect is used**

There are three main cases:

#### a) Performatives
The speaker's utterance itself performs the act named by the verb.
- The act is complete with the utterance

**Example:**
- I **congratulate** you on your success.
  - By uttering this, the speaker actually performs the act of congratulating

**Contrast with:**
- Oh, some friends of Tony's are here. They **'re congratulating** him on his success, I suppose.
  - Speaker B refers to an act going on 'now', but B's words do not perform this act

#### b) Sudden Events
If an event is suddenly seen as occurring in its entirety at the time of speaking:
- May be referred to in a sentence introduced by a **stressed adverb** with **inversion**
- In spoken English: chiefly **here** and **there** with **come** and **go**

**Example:**
- **There goes** the last bus! (but: There it goes!)
- **Here comes** the teacher!

#### c) Live Commentary
In reports of sports events or demonstrations:
- Events mentioned as they occur
- Simple aspect is used
- In accordance with aspect in past-time narrative (see Preterite)

**Examples:**
- Turner **passes** to MacGregor – MacGregor **shoots** – goal!
- First I **break** the eggs into this large bowl. Then I **whisk** them gently till they're frothy...

---

### 2.4 TEMPORALLY UNBOUNDED SITUATIONS

#### Rule
**Simple aspect is used** for temporally unbounded situations.

#### Examples
- The freezer **makes** such a noise that we keep it in the basement. (permanent characteristic)
- I **cycle** to work. It's quicker and cheaper than the bus. (habitual)

**Note:** See B 4.2.3 for detailed explanation of inclusive time reference.

---

### 2.5 SERIES OF SITUATIONS

#### Rule
A series of situations cannot be seen as occurring complete 'now'.

At the time of speaking:
- An **inherently bounded** (22) or **temporally bounded** (23) bounded series can only be seen as **in progress**
- Therefore: **Progressive aspect**

**Simple aspect is used for unbounded series** (24, 28).

#### Examples - Bounded Series in Progress
- Sal **'s making** three new bookcases for me. The first one's finished already. (inherently bounded series)
- I **'m cycling** to work as long as the weather's so good. (temporally bounded series)

#### Examples - Unbounded Series
- I **cycle** to work. It's quicker and cheaper than the bus. (habitual)
- He **always leaves** the porch light on for me when I'm out late. (regular habit)

---

### 2.5.1 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES IN A SERIES

#### Unbounded Series

**Progressive Aspect** is used when:
- Each instance is seen as having already started and not yet finished on the occasions indicated contextually

**Simple Aspect** is used when:
- Each instance is seen as occurring in its entirety on the occasions indicated contextually

**Examples:**
- I **see** him every morning. He **'s taking** his dog for a walk when I go down to the village for my breakfast croissant, and I always **give** the dog a biscuit. (Progressive for instance in progress; Simple for complete action)
- I **'m giving** the children their meals while their mother is in hospital. I **take** them to school and **do** the shopping as well. (Progressive establishes bounded series; Simple for complete actions within frame)

#### Bounded Series
Once the series has been established as temporary and in progress:
- **Simple aspect** is used for associated situations when each instance is seen as occurring in its entirety

**Example:**
- I **'m giving** the children their meals while their mother is in hospital. I **take** them to school and **do** the shopping as well.

---

### 2.5.2 IDENTITY OF REFERENCE

#### Rule
**Progressive aspect** is used for the 'interpretive' representation of the situation:
- 'when x occurs, what is actually going on is y'

#### Example
- They **go** to the opera regularly even though they're quite unmusical. They **'re only trying** to impress the neighbours.
  - Going to opera = trying to impress neighbours (identity of reference)

---

### 2.5.3 ALWAYS + PROGRESSIVE: FREQUENTLY BUT SPORADICALLY

#### Special Use
Progressive aspect is used with **always, forever, constantly, continually** in the sense of:
- **'Frequently but sporadically'**
- Characteristic behavior of the subject
- Could find the subject doing this at any time
- No 'whenever' sense

#### Examples
- He **'s so forgetful**. He **'s always leaving** the light on all night.
- They **'re really hard to please**. They **'re always complaining**.

**German equivalent:** ständig, dauernd, immer wieder

**Note:** This contrasts with the normal use of always + Progressive where individual instances have already started and not yet finished whenever...

---

## 3. THE PRESENT TENSE AND PAST TIME

The Present tense is used to refer to situations in the **real or fictitious past** in certain cases.

### 3.1 PAST UTTERANCES WITH PRESENT RELEVANCE

#### Rule
As in German, the Present Simple can be used to refer to a spoken or written past utterance when:
- Speaker is concerned not with the speech act itself
- Or with the past circumstances of performing it
- But with **its content** and the **relevance of this at the present time of speaking**

#### Examples
- The doctor **says** it isn't serious and he'll be all right in a day or two. (doctor's words still relevant now)
- In his autobiography Betjeman **speaks** of the experiences of childhood, but the past he longs for is not his own. (literary present - author's words still exist)

---

### 3.2 SUMMARIES; THE HISTORIC PRESENT

#### Historic Present
The Present tense (so-called Historic Present) is sometimes used to narrate past events:
- Not so frequently in English as in German

#### Summaries
More important: Present tense for complete events in summaries of:
- Contents of literary works
- Plots, stories, historical events

**Example:**
- In Hamlet, the Prince **returns** from Wittenberg to the Danish court. There his father's ghost **appears** to him one night while he's walking on the castle ramparts...

**Note:** Aspect is chosen in accordance with the rules for the Preterite.

---

## 4. THE PRESENT TENSE AND FUTURE TIME

### Rule
When a future event has already been put in train (initiated):
- It has been decided on with consequent specific plans and arrangements
- This can be seen as a preliminary phase of the overall situation
- When speaker knows personal arrangements for future event exist:
  - **Present Progressive** is used to indicate situation is already in progress in this sense

### 4.1 PERSONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR FUTURE EVENTS

#### Present Progressive for Future
Used when there are **personal arrangements** for a future event known to exist 'now'.

#### Examples
- We **'re taking** the kids to the zoo this afternoon. (plans already made)
- We **'re having** the Browns to dinner on Friday.
- Jenna **'s giving** a party on Saturday. I wonder who she's invited.

**Note:** This is different from simple timetable future (see below).

---

### 4.2 TIMETABLE FUTURE

#### Rule
In spoken English, Simple aspect involving future time reference is relatively rare.

#### When Used
Occurs in the case of:
- **'Timetable' events** (public schedules, fixed times)
- **Non-personally fixed dates**

#### Examples
- The York train **leaves** at 6.30, so I'll have to hurry.
- The meeting **is to be held** on 23 September. (passive form - be to)

**Note:** Does not occur in the passive at all (use **be to**) (36).

---

### 4.3 SUGGESTIONS

#### Common Pattern
A common way of making suggestions for future action in informal English:
- **Negative question** with **Simple aspect**
- Pattern: 'Why don't you...?'

#### Example
- It's difficult to cut with a knife. **Why don't you use** the scissors?
