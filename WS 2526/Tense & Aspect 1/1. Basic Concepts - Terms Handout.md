# Basic Concepts and Terms - Grammar I

## 1. SITUATION

### Definition
The term **situation** covers any event, process, activity, state, etc. as it is seen by the speaker and represented in a sentence. All parts of the sentence interact to produce the desired representation, but we are particularly concerned with the way **tense and aspect** combine with other factors:

- The meaning of the predicator with its complements ('Ergänzungen')
- The combination of (a) with adjuncts ('adverbiale Bestimmungen')
- The context in which the sentence occurs

---

## 2. SITUATION TYPES

### The Basic Distinction: Dynamic vs. Stative

The most basic distinction is that between **dynamic** and **stative** situations.

**Example 1 - Dynamic:**
- He ate an apple. (action/event)

**Example 2 - Stative:**
- She is tall. (state)

---

### 2.1 DYNAMIC SITUATIONS

Dynamic situations are:
- Acts, actions, activities, processes
- Kinds of **'doing'** or **'happening'**

**Examples:**
- She wrote a letter to her mother. (action)
- The children played quietly with their Lego. (activity)

**Characteristics:**
- Involve change or movement
- Have internal development
- Can be controlled (actions) or not (events)

---

### 2.2 STATIVE SITUATIONS

States:
- Exist, are static (opposite of dynamic)
- Kinds of **'being'** and **'having'**

There are **three main subtypes** of stative situations:

#### Type 1: Property Ascription
A property ('Merkmal') is ascribed ('wird zugeschrieben') to something.

**Examples:**
- She is very nice. (property: nice)
- The house has a red roof. (property: red roof)
- It doesn't matter ('it is not important')
- The wardrobe smelled of mothballs. (property: smell)

#### Type 2: Existential-Locative Situations
**Examples:**
- The box contained pills ('there were pills in the box')
- The laptop's in your bag. (location)

#### Type 3: Mental or Emotional States or Attitudes
**Examples:**
- I think he's a good actor. (mental state)
- I like her. (emotional state)

**Key Characteristic:** Stative situations are **internally unchanging** - they don't involve internal development towards an endpoint.

---

### 2.3 STATIVE-DYNAMIC SITUATIONS

Some verbs are chiefly used in representing situations with **both stative and dynamic characteristics**.

#### Group (a): Posture Verbs
- sit, stand, lie

#### Group (b): Other Verbs
- live, wear, etc.

**Examples:**
- She sat on the sofa with her eyes closed. (could be temporary state or dynamic action)
- She was standing dejectedly by the window.
- She's wearing that dress because she knows it's my favourite.

**Note:** The choice between stative and dynamic interpretation depends on context and aspect choice.

---

## 3. SITUATIONS, TIME, AND TENSE

### Tense Function
Tense (marked on the verb) indicates the **time relation** between:
- The time at which the speaker utters the sentence (the **present moment 'now'**, often called the **speaker's zero point**)
- The time of the situation the speaker is referring to

### The Basic Temporal Distinction
The English tense system makes a basic distinction between:
- **Non-past** (present and future time)
- **Past time**

### English Primary Tenses
English has **two primary tenses**:

1. **Present Tense**
   - Used for referring to non-past situations (present and future)

2. **Preterite** (Past Tense)
   - Used for referring to past situations

### Secondary Tenses
Each primary tense has a secondary tense associated with it:
- **Present Perfect** (associated with Present)
- **Past Perfect** (associated with Preterite)

**Important Note:** English has **no future tense**. Future time is expressed in other ways.

---

## 4. SITUATION AND ASPECT

### Aspect Definition
The predicator is always marked for aspect, as:
- **Progressive** (be + -ing)
- **non-Progressive** (i.e., **Simple**)

Aspect reflects the way speakers **look at a situation** in relation to time:

#### Progressive Aspect
Speakers view the situation as:
- Going through some phase of its internal progress towards its end
- Having **already started** and **not yet finished** at a contextually relevant point or points of time
- In relation to 'now' or some other contextually established time

**Example:**
- I was slowly and cautiously opening the door when Tim came quietly up behind me.

#### Simple Aspect
Speakers view the situation as:
- Occurring in its entirety at the contextually relevant time

**Example:**
- I opened the door and saw that Tim was on the other side.

---

### 4.1 ASPECT AND STATIVE SITUATIONS

Since states are seen as:
- Static
- Internally unchanging

The **Simple aspect is always used**.

The question of whether they are temporally bounded ('zeitlich begrenzt') is irrelevant for stative situations.

**Examples:**
- ✓ She is tall. (stative + simple)
- ✗ *She is being tall.* (stative + progressive - incorrect)

---

### 4.2 ASPECT AND DYNAMIC OR STATIVE-DYNAMIC SITUATIONS

#### 4.2.1 INHERENTLY BOUNDED (TELIC) DYNAMIC SITUATIONS

Some situations are **inherently bounded** ('ihrem Wesen nach zwangsläufig begrenzt'):
- There is an **inherent or 'built-in' end point**
- The situation develops towards this end point
- At the end point, it becomes complete
- Beyond the end point, it cannot continue

**Test for inherently bounded situation:**
If the sentence in the Present Progressive is true, the sentence in the Present Perfect Simple cannot be true.

**Example:**
- She is eating the apple I gave her. (true now = not finished)
- She has eaten the apple I gave her. (true now = finished)
- **Cannot both be true at the same time**

**Aspect Choice for Inherently Bounded Situations:**

| Aspect | View | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Simple** | Occurring in its entirety (including end point) | She ate the apple. |
| **Progressive** | Having started and not yet finished | She is eating the apple. |

#### 4.2.2 TEMPORALLY BOUNDED AND UNBOUNDED DYNAMIC SITUATIONS

##### TEMPORALLY UNBOUNDED SITUATIONS

Situations seen as obtaining indefinitely ('als zeitlich unbegrenzt'):
- No end to such situations is envisaged ('ins Auge gefaßt')
- Seen as 'the same' at any time
- It would not make sense to represent them as being in progress towards an end point
- **Simple aspect is therefore used**

**Inclusive Time Reference:**
A situation seen as temporally unbounded has **inclusive time reference**.

- **Inclusive present:** Already obtains with no end envisaged at the present moment
- **Inclusive past:** Already obtained with no end envisaged at some past time

**Examples - Inclusive Present:**
- The Neckar flows into the Rhine. (permanent geographical fact)
- They live in London. (permanent residence)

**Example - Inclusive Past:**
- [An old friend came to see them that day.] He ran a repair shop in the nearby town.

##### TEMPORALLY BOUNDED SITUATIONS

A dynamic or stative-dynamic situation may be seen as temporally bounded:
- Temporary (an end is envisaged)

This temporary nature may be:
- **Regarded as being a matter of course** (no specific indication)
- **Indicated contextually** (e.g., by an adverbial)

**Examples:**
- They're sitting in the garden. (temporary - matter of course)
- They're living with her mother till they can find a flat of their own. (temporary - indicated by adverbial)

**Aspect Choice for Temporally Bounded Situations:**

| View | Aspect | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Having started and not yet finished | Progressive | They're living with her mother. |
| Occurring in its entirety | Simple | They sat in the garden yesterday afternoon and went to the cinema in the evening. |

---

## 5. RECURRENCE AND SERIES OF SITUATIONS

A speaker may refer not to one individual situation but to a **series** ('Folge/Menge') of situations.

A series may be:
- **Bounded** or **unbounded**
- In the same way as an individual situation:
  - Inherently bounded
  - Temporally bounded (temporary)
  - Unbounded

### Aspect Choice for Series

| Series Type | View | Aspect | Example |
|-------------|------|--------|---------|
| Bounded (inherently/temporally) | In progress | Progressive | He is making five important speeches in all in Dorset. |
| Bounded | In entirety | Simple | I wrote three letters last night. |
| Unbounded | - | Simple | He sometimes comes to see us. |

### 5.1 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES IN A SERIES

When the occasions are indicated on which individual instances of the series occur:

| View | Aspect | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Each instance seen as occurring in its entirety | Simple | Mrs. Sagei sits at her window every day. When I pass her house, she lifts her hand and waves to me. |
| Each instance seen as having started and not yet finished | Progressive | Whenever I pass her house, Mrs. Sagei is sitting at her window watching the passers-by. |

### Special Case: Bounded Series Already in Progress

Once it has been established that a series is:
- Temporary
- Already started and not yet finished

Then **Simple aspect is used** for associated situations seen as occurring in their entirety on every appropriate occasion within the previously established temporal frame.

**Example:**
- My mother has gone to help my sister with her new baby, so I'm starting work an hour earlier at the moment and doing without my lunch break. This way I get home before Alan comes home from school.

**Explanation:**
- "I'm starting work an hour earlier at the moment" establishes the temporary series in progress
- Within this frame, "I get home" (complete event) before Alan comes home on each occasion

---

### 5.1.1 ASPECT WITH ALWAYS AND CERTAIN SYNONYMS

#### ALWAYS + SIMPLE ASPECT

Used when:
- An instance of a series occurs complete on every occasion
- Or only on the occasions indicated by the context

**Examples:**
- He always brings me flowers on my birthday. (whenever it's my birthday)
- He always comes at seven. (whenever he comes, it's at seven / whenever it's seven o'clock, he comes)

#### ALWAYS + PROGRESSIVE ASPECT

Used when:
- Each occurrence is viewed individually as having already started on every occasion indicated by the context

**Example:**
- I see him every morning. He's always taking his dog for a walk when I go out to get my croissant.

#### Special Use: Frequently but Sporadically

There's also a use of **always + Progressive** where it is not linked invariably to a 'when':
- Makes occurrence of the situation unpredictable ('unvorhersehbar')
- One may come across it in progress at any time
- Meaning: **'frequently but sporadically'**

**Examples:**
- He is very attentive. He is always bringing me flowers.
- They're really hard to please. They're always complaining.

**Notes:**
1. In addition to always: **forever** (especially informal), **constantly**, **continually**
2. German equivalent: immer wieder / ständig / dauernd
3. Adverb must be placed between auxiliary and lexical verb
4. Construction occurs only in Present and Preterite

---

## 6. ASPECT AND IDENTITY OF REFERENCE

### Definition
Two sentences can refer to the **same reality** (identity of reference):
- One sentence introduces the situation
- The other offers an interpretation of it

### Aspect Rule
Whatever the aspect of the 'introductory' representation:
- The aspect of the 'interpretive' representation is **Progressive**
- Meaning: **'when x occurs, what is actually going on is y'**

**Example 1 - Identity of Reference:**
- She left some flowers on my desk this morning. She was apologizing for her behaviour yesterday, I suppose.
- **Meaning:** 'leaving flowers' = 'apologizing'

**Example 2 - Two Separate Situations:**
- She left some flowers on my desk this morning. And (then) she apologized for her behaviour yesterday.
- **Meaning:** Two distinct situations (even though there may be some connection)

---

## 7. ASPECT AND VOICE

### Same Rules Apply
The same rules of aspect apply to **passive** as to **active** predicators.

### Important Distinction: Stative vs. Dynamic Passive

#### Dynamic Passive
- Used in representations of **dynamic situations**
- German auxiliary verb: **werden**

**Example:**
- The door is being painted, so be careful when you go out.
- The door is painted every year.

#### Stative Passive
- Used in representations of a **state**
- State that results from completion of a dynamic situation
- German auxiliary verb: **sein**

**Example:**
- The door is painted green. (state - the door is now green)

---

## 8. SITUATIONS, VERB MEANING AND ASPECT

### Key Principle
While the predicator is marked for tense and aspect, these categories are:
- Properties of the **sentence representing the situations**
- **Not of the verb alone**

### Verb Categories

#### 1. Verbs Always/Seldom Used with Progressive
Some verbs are always or almost always used exclusively in representing stative situations and therefore:
- Never or seldom occur with Progressive aspect

#### 2. Verbs with Both Stative and Dynamic Senses
Many verbs have both stative and dynamic senses ('Einzelbedeutungen') and can be used in:
- Representation of both stative and dynamic situations
- Aspect chosen according to the rules described above

##### Group 1: Be and Have
Used most frequently for stative situations but possible with dynamic situations.

**BE - Dynamic Sense:**
Used in representations of **deliberate behaviour**
- Meaning: 'behave in the manner indicated by the predicative adjective'

**Example:**
- Martin is being very helpful – he has lent us his tools and he says he'll come round and give us a hand at the weekend.
- **Note:** May or may not be characteristic of Martin; speaker is interested in behaviour on this particular occasion

**HAVE - Dynamic Sense:**
Used in expressions denoting actions or activity

**Example:**
- I'm sorry we didn't hear you ring the bell. We were having tea in the garden about four.

##### Group 2: Mental/Emotional State Verbs
Many verbs with senses denoting mental or emotional states also have dynamic senses denoting mental/emotional processes.

**Examples - Stative (State):**
- I think it's lovely.
- I hope they'll come soon.

**Examples - Dynamic (Process):**
- I'm thinking of going to Edinburgh for my holiday this year, but nothing's settled yet.
- I'm hoping you'll be able to help us.
  - **Note:** Progressive makes the hope more tentative and therefore more polite (hope not fully formed)

##### Group 3: Predominantly Dynamic Verbs
Verbs with predominantly dynamic senses can be used with **simple aspect** for situations that are:
- Stative in character
- Temporally unbounded
- A property or potential for some activity is attributed to the subject
- Instances of the corresponding activity can occur at any time

**Examples:**
- He plays the piano and she plays the flute. (ability/potential)
- This shirt washes well. (inherent property)

##### Group 4: Verbs of Physical Perception

| Verb | Stative Transitive | Stative Intransitive | Dynamic |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|---------|
| **smell** | (9) 'riechen' | (10-11) 'riechen nach' | (12-13) 'riechen an'; sniff (at) |
| **taste** | 'schmecken' | 'schmecken nach' | 'kosten' |
| **feel¹** | (14) 'spüren' | (15) 'sich anfühlen' | (17) 'befühlen' |
| **feel²** | - | (16) 'sich fühlen' - sensation perceived by subject | - |
| **see** | (18) 'sehen, erblicken' | - | - |
| **look** | - | (19) 'aussehen'** | (20) 'sich (etwas) ansehen' |
| **hear** | 'hören' | - | - |
| **sound** | - | 'klingen, sich anhören' | - |
| **listen** | - | - | 'hören, sich (etwas) anhören' |

**Notes on Progressive with Ascriptive Verbs:**
- Stative senses used with simple aspect
- In the case of ascriptive **look** and more frequently **feel²** (perceived by subject), Progressive is a possible (though never necessary) alternative when temporary
- Also applies to: hurt, ache ('feel sore'), itch ('feel itchy'), etc.
- Ascriptive **smell** occasionally used the same way

**Examples of Physical Perception Verbs:**

**Smell:**
- (9) I (can) smell mothballs. (stative - experiencing sensation triggered by object)
- (10) This cupboard smells of mothballs. / There's a smell of mothballs in this cupboard. (stative - state ascribed to subject)
- (11) This cheese smells. It smells awful. (stative - state ascribed to subject)
- (12) Look – your dog's smelling the food (sniffling at the food) I put down for him. (dynamic - subject acts to achieve sensation)
- (13) He always smells his food before he touches it. (dynamic - subject acts to achieve sensation)

**Feel:**
- (14) He's lucky. He doesn't feel the heat. (stative - experiencing sensation triggered by object)
- (15) This cardigan feels beautifully soft. (stative - state ascribed to subject)
- (16) I don't feel well. / I'm not feeling well. (stative - sensation perceived by subject; Progressive possible for temporary state)
- (17) Feel this cardigan – isn't it soft! (dynamic - subject acts to achieve sensation)

**See and Look:**
- (18) I (can) see the white cliffs of Dover. (stative - experiencing sensation triggered by object)
- (19) They look gorgeous in this light. (stative - state ascribed to subject)
- (20) Jane's looking at him as if she was never going to see him again. (dynamic - subject acts to achieve sensation)
