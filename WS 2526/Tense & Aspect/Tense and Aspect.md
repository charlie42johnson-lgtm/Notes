# Progressive vs. Simple:


| **Definition: Stative situation**            | A stative situation is a state, a kind of being or having.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition: Dynamic situation**            | A dynamic situation is an act / action / activity / process, a kind of doing or happening.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Bounded vs. Unbounded situations**         | States and dynamic situations can be either bounded (limited in time) or unbounded (not seen as limited in time).                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Usage of "Simple" (States)**               | Simple is used in talking about states (kinds of being and having).                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Examples: Simple (States)**                | 1. She’s German.<br><br>  <br><br>2. He was tired.<br><br>  <br><br>3. I think I love you.<br><br>  <br><br>4. They owned a large vineyard in the Napa Valley.                                                                                                           |
| **Usage of "Simple" (Unbounded Dynamic)**    | Simple is used in talking about unbounded dynamic situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Examples: Simple (Unbounded Dynamic)**     | 1. The Neckar flows into the Rhine.<br><br>  <br><br>2. The planet Zog orbited two suns, and clouds of tririllium dust swirled around its surface.                                                                                                                       |
| **Usage of "Simple" (Bounded Dynamic)**      | Simple is used for bounded dynamic situations seen as occurring in their entirety.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

She sang my favourite song. I cried when she finished.<br><br>  <br><br>4. She sang my favourite song. I cried all the way through. |
| **Usage of "Progressive" (Bounded Dynamic)** | Progressive is used for bounded dynamic situations seen as having already started and not yet finished.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Examples: Progressive (Bounded Dynamic)**  | 1. I’m just having breakfast. I’ll call you back in a minute.<br><br>  <br><br>2. He was singing No Woman, No Cry when he fell off the stage.<br><br>  <br><br>3. She sang my favourite song. By the time she finished, I was crying my eyes out.                        |
| **Usage of "Progressive" (Future Plans)**    | Progressive is used for plans or arrangements already in place for a dynamic situation to occur in the future.                                                                                                                                                           |

# Aspect & Series:


| **General Rule: Aspect choice for series**             | The principles governing aspect choice for series are the same as those governing aspect choice for singular situations.                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Series of stative situations**                       | Referred to using the **Simple** aspect. Example: "We’re in room 115 on Wednesday mornings".                                                                                                    |
| **Definition: "Series" of situations**                 | A collection of situations where the same situation is repeated; it starts and stops, occurring a number of times.                                                                              |
| **Definition: "Individual instances"**                 | These refer to the specific times a situation occurs within a series. Individual instances are always bounded.                                                                                  |
| **Levels of talking about a series**                   | 1. Talking about the series as a series.<br><br>  <br><br>2. Talking about the individual instances of the series.                                                                              |
| **Simple Aspect: Unbounded series (No focus)**         | Used for an unbounded series with no focus on individual instances. Example: "She reads a lot".                                                                                                 |
| **Simple Aspect: Unbounded series (Entirety)**         | Used for an unbounded series with each instance seen as occurring in its entirety. Example: "She cycles to uni".                                                                                |
| **Simple Aspect: Bounded series (Entirety)**           | Used for a bounded series seen as occurring in its entirety. Example: "She cycled to uni all last semester".                                                                                    |
| **Simple Aspect: Individual instances (Entirety)**     | Used for individual instances seen as occurring in their entirety in a bounded or unbounded series. Example: "Whenever they see me, they shout at me".                                          |
| **Progressive Aspect: Bounded series (Ongoing)**       | Used to establish that a series is bounded and seen as having already started and not yet finished. Example: "She’s cycling to uni this semester".                                              |
| **Progressive Aspect: Individual instances (Ongoing)** | Used for individual instances seen as having already started and not yet finished in a series. Example: "Whenever I see them, they’re shouting at someone".                                     |
| **Special Use: "Always" + Progressive (Sporadic)**     | Indicates "frequently but sporadically" behavior. The situation is characteristic behavior; often translated in German with _ständig_ or _dauernd_. Example: "He’s always bringing me flowers". |
| **Special Use: "Identity of Reference"**               | Progressive can be used for series to identify the nature of the action. Example: "They go to the opera... They’re just trying to impress the neighbours".                                      |

# Special Uses of Progressive:


| **Basic Meaning: Progressive**              | A bounded, dynamic situation or series has already started and not yet finished at the contextually relevant point(s) of time.                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relevance: Boundedness**                  | The progressive can indicate a dynamic situation or series is seen as limited in time (will finish). Example: "I could see that he was working" (He was busy).                                |
| **Relevance: Already Started**              | The progressive can indicate a bounded, dynamic situation has already started. Example: "Whenever I see him, he’s shouting at his kids".                                                      |
| **Future: Personal Plans**                  | Used for personal plans or arrangements for the future. Example: "They’re taking the kids to the zoo on Saturday".                                                                            |
| **Future: Refusal or Insistence**           | Used to express the speaker’s refusal or insistence for the future. Examples: "I’m not doing that!" or "you’re coming home with me!".                                                         |
| **Identity of Reference**                   | Used for the speaker’s interpretation of a situation already referred to. Example: "She put flowers on my desk... I expect she was apologising".                                              |
| **Past Tense: Saying & Telling**            | Used with verbs of saying and telling in the past tense to indicate simply that there was a conversation. Example: "I was talking to Peter the other day, and he says...".                    |
| **"Always" + Progressive (Sporadic)**       | Indicates the situation could be found happening at any time (no "whenever" sense); often translated with German _ständig_ or _dauernd_. Example: "he’s always complaining".                  |
| **Progressive with Perfect (Activity)**     | Indicates activity throughout a specified period or recent activity that may or may not be finished. Examples: "I’ve been playing the piano for five years" or "I’ve been doing my homework". |

| **Why a time is seen as "pre-present"**                | 1. A period up to the present is specified by the speaker.<br><br>  <br><br>2. The sense is “at any time before now”.<br><br>  <br><br>3. The sense is “recently before now,” the hearer is not told the particular time meant, and has no relevant knowledge yet.                                          |

| **Context for Past Perfect**                           | Speaker and hearer already have a past time in mind, and the situation happens or exists before or up to this already established past time.                                                                                                                                                                |

# The Future:


| **Future: Personal Arrangements or Plans**   | Expressed using **Present Progressive**. Sense: X has planned or arranged to do something. Example: "We're taking the kids to the zoo".                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Future: Scheduled Arrangements**           | Expressed using **Present Simple** (or Progressive in informal style). Sense: A time has been officially or externally fixed. Example: "The film starts at eight".                                             |
| **Future: Intentions**                       | Expressed using **be going to + infinitive**. Sense: X intends to or has decided to do something. Example: "I'm going to call the police".                                                                     |
| **Future: Spontaneous Decisions**            | Expressed using **will + infinitive**. Sense: A promise, offer, or threat made in reaction to something that just happened. Example: "(Telephone rings) I'll get it!".                                         |
| **Future: Predictions (Present Signs)**      | Expressed using **be going to + infinitive**. Sense: A prediction based on concrete signs that exist in the present. Example: "I think I'm going to be sick".                                                  |
| **Future: Predictions (Purely Future Time)** | Expressed using **will + infinitive**. Sense: Focusing on an exclusively future time, often based on knowledge/experience rather than present signs. Example: "I'm sure you'll do very well".                  |
| **Future: Indirect Assumptions**             | Expressed using **will + progressive infinitive**. Sense: Something expected to happen in the normal course of events or as a result of another planned event. Example: "I'll be changing trains in Mannheim". |
| **Future States (Limitations)**              | In talking about future states, the progressive is not possible. **Will + simple infinitive** is normally used for the full range of meanings.                                                                 |
| **Future in Adverbial Clauses of Time**      | Purely future "will" is never used in temporal clauses with future time reference. There should be no indication of purely future time on the verb. Example: "I'll call you as soon as I get home".            |
