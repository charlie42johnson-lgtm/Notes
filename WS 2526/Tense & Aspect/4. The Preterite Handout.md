# The Preterite Handout

## Introduction

This handout covers specific issues with the **Preterite** (Past Tense). 

**Prerequisites:**
- Knowledge of "Basic Concepts and Terms"
- Knowledge of "The Present Tense"

**Reference System:**
- **B** = References to paragraphs in "Basic Concepts and Terms" (e.g., B 5.1)
- **§** = References to paragraphs in "The Preterite" (e.g., § 2.1)

---

## 1. TENSE: THE PRETERITE AND PAST TIME

### Core Definition
The speaker uses a **Preterite verb form** when referring to a situation that the speaker considers **identifiable by the hearer as past** in relation to the present time of speaking.

**Important:** This does not mean that the time of the past situation necessarily is, or can be, precisely specified by the speaker.

---

### 1.1 THE MEANS OF PAST IDENTIFICATION

There are **two main means** of past identification:

#### Method 1: Speaker Presupposes Hearer Knowledge

The speaker presupposes ('setzt voraus') that the hearer has enough information to identify the situation as past **without the help of a Preterite verb form**.

This knowledge can come from:

##### a) Shared General Knowledge
Knowledge that both speaker and hearer share about the world.

**Example:**
- Queen Victoria **married** a German prince.
  - Shared knowledge: Queen Victoria is dead → her actions are past
  - No need for past-marking adverbial

##### b) Other Shared Knowledge
Knowledge from previous conversations, arrangements, or shared experiences.

**Example:**
- Oh, by the way, I **bought** those tickets.
  - Context: Previously arranged to get tickets
  - Shared knowledge makes the action identifiable as past

##### c) Shared Knowledge from Context
Knowledge established by the linguistic and/or situational context of utterance.

**Example 1:**
- Look – someone has broken the window. They probably **used** this stone from our garden.
  - First sentence establishes window is now broken
  - Entails: breaking act must be past
  - Therefore: circumstances (using stone) are also past

**Example 2:**
- It's nice to see you, Tom. – But I **thought** you had gone to Birmingham.
  - Present knowledge: Tom is not in Birmingham now
  - Contrasts with: mental attitude in second sentence
  - Therefore: thought must be past

---

#### Method 2: Speaker Supplies Past Identification

Alternatively, or in addition, the speaker supplies the hearer with the means of past identification by using:
- An adverbial that can only refer to past time
- In the same or an earlier sentence

**Examples:**
- My mother **arrived yesterday**. She **came** on her own by train even though she's ninety-five.
- He always **spent** his summer holidays by the sea when he was a child.
- Oh no, it's nearly six o'clock. Do you think the baker's will have any baguettes left? I **forgot** to buy one this morning.

---

### Note on Temporal Adverbials

#### Type A: Unambiguously Past
Some adverbials can only be used in referring to past time.

**Examples:**
- yesterday
- last week/year/Monday
- five minutes ago
- in 1999
- when I was a child

**Example sentence:**
- My mother **arrived yesterday**.

---

#### Type B: Contextually Past
Other adverbials may be used in referring to either the future or the past.
- In the latter case, the combination of adverbial + Preterite identifies the situation as past

**Examples:**
- I **went** to a concert on Saturday. (past - Preterite used)
- I **'m going** to a concert on Saturday. (future - Present Progressive used)

---

#### Type C: Time-Span Includes Present
The meaning of a third group of adverbials is such that their time-spans include the present time of speaking.
- Context and/or combination with Preterite makes reference to a past part of the time-span clear

**Examples:**
- today
- this morning/afternoon/week/month/year

**Example 1:**
- [at 11 a.m.] A: That's a lovely necklace. I haven't seen it before, have I?
  - B: No, I **bought** it only this morning.
  - 'This morning' includes present, but Preterite identifies past part of time-span
  - A 'now' has the necklace → acquisition must be in past part of 'this morning'

**Example 2:**
- [at 11 a.m.] Mr Johnson is usually in the staff room when I arrive in the mornings, but I **didn't see** him today.
  - Context makes clear: 'didn't see him' located at past part of 'today' when 'I' arrived

**Example 3:**
- [at 11 a.m.] I **saw** Terry this morning. He seems to have completely recovered from his accident.
  - Preterite identifies past part of 'this morning'

**Contrast with Present Perfect:**
- A: Can you tell me where Mr Johnson is?
- B: I'm afraid not. I **haven't seen** him today.
  - Here: 'so far today' (time-span up to now)
  - See "The Present Perfect" for details

---

### 1.2 USED TO

#### Basic Facts
- **used to** is used only in referring to past situations that are **serial or stative**
- There is **no form** of used to that can occur with reference to present time

#### Two Basic Functions

##### Function 1: Establish Pastness with Present Contrast
To establish that a state or series of dynamic situations **belongs to the past**.
- 'Contrast with the present' is often implied

**Examples:**
- It's a very quiet spot. I **used to go** jogging there every day. A gentle walk is all I can manage nowadays though.
  - Clear contrast: past jogging vs. present walking

- A: Do you have a job?
  - B: Not now, but I **used to be** a teacher.
  - Clear contrast: past employment vs. present unemployment

**Note:** Would not be possible to substitute **went** for **used to go** in first example, nor **was** for **used to be** in second, unless further past identification were added.

**With additional past identification:**
- When I was younger, I **went** jogging every day.

**German equivalent:** Uses adverbials like **früher** to contrast with the present.

---

##### Function 2: Unambiguous Marker of Habit
In a context otherwise identified as past, **used to** may function chiefly as an unambiguous marker of 'habit'.
- Especially when the situation would otherwise not be clearly identified as serial.

**Example:**
- She hasn't changed a bit – she was just as unpleasant as a young woman. She **used to quarrel** with her family then, too.
  - Context already past ('then')
  - **used to** clearly marks quarreling as serial (habitual)

---

#### Note on Temporal Adverbials with USED TO

The only temporal adverbials possible with **used to** are ones denoting:
- A time-span sufficiently long to allow the given situation to be seen as habitual
- And, in the case of 'contrast with present', where the end point of the period is imprecise

**Examples:**
- **As a child**, I **used to feed** the ducks here. (sufficiently long time-span)
- **When I was younger**, I **used to go** jogging there every day. (imprecise end point)

---

#### Forms of USED TO

| Form | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Positive** | I used to live there. |
| **Negative** | I **did not use to** / **never used to** live there. (sometimes **used not to**) |
| **Past Perfect** | I **had used to**... (very rare) |

**Note:** No other forms exist (no present, no progressive, etc.)

---

#### Aspect of Infinitive After USED TO

The aspect is usually **Simple**.

However, when each individual instance in the series is seen as in progress on the occasions indicated contextually, the aspect is **Progressive**.

**Example:**
- My mother always **used to be waiting** for me at the gate when I got out of school.
  - Each instance: mother was in progress of waiting when school ended

---

### 1.3 CONTRASTIVE STRESS

#### Function
When the situation is 'given' (recoverable from the context), **contrastive stress** may combine with:
- The Preterite of an auxiliary verb (**did**)
- Or **be**

This provides past identification and, in spoken English, is an alternative to a **used to** construction where 'contrast with the present' is implied.

**Example:**
- A: You live there too, don't you?
  - B: Well, I **did**, but we have a house out at Greenbank now.
    - Stress on **did** = contrast with present
    - Implied: I don't live there now

---

### 1.4 SUMMARY OF SECTION 1: PAST IDENTIFICATION

#### Past Identification Methods

| Method | Example | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **General knowledge** | Queen Victoria married... | Shared world knowledge |
| **Other shared knowledge** | I bought those tickets. | Previous arrangements |
| **Context established** | Someone has broken the window. They used this stone. | Situational context |
| **Used to (contrast)** | I used to be a teacher. | Contrast with present |
| **Used to (habit marker)** | She used to quarrel with her family. | Unambiguous serial marker |
| **Contrastive stress** | I **did** live there. | Spoken alternative to used to |

#### Temporal Adverbials

| Type | Example | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Unambiguously past** | yesterday, last week | Only past reference |
| **Contextually past** | on Saturday + Preterite | Saturday just past |
| **Time-span includes present** | this morning + Preterite | Past part of time-span |
| **With used to** | as a child, when I was younger | Sufficiently long time-span |

---

## 2. THE PRETERITE AND ASPECT IN (STATIVE-)DYNAMIC SITUATIONS

### Fundamental Difference: Present vs. Preterite

| Tense | Time Relation |
|-------|---------------|
| **Present** | Always relates situation to speaker's zero point ('now') |
| **Preterite** | Looks back from zero point; relates situation to past time |

### Types of Past Time Reference

1. **Past point of time** (e.g., at 3 o'clock)
2. **Past period of time** (e.g., yesterday afternoon)
3. **Time represented by another past situation** (e.g., as soon as he heard the news)

**Examples:**
- He isn't here. He **left** for Paris at three o'clock. (past point)
- He isn't here. He **left** for Paris yesterday afternoon. (past period)
- He isn't here. He **left** for Paris as soon as he **heard** the news. (triggered by past situation)

---

### 2.1 PAST POINT OF TIME

When a speaker relates a situation to a past point of time, the speaker sees the situation as, at that time:

#### a) In Progress → Progressive Aspect

**Examples:**
- They **were playing** tennis with the Harrisons at nine this morning.
- I **was making** a cake when the milkman called for his money.
- I looked across at the other table. Pedro **was grinning**.

**Special Case:** Situation whose precise initial point was unobserved and therefore noticed to be already in progress at some point thereafter.

**Example:**
- The clock **struck** midnight. A moment later everyone **was cheering** and laughing and clinking glasses.
  - Cheering was already in progress when noticed

---

#### b) Occurring Complete → Simple Aspect

**Examples:**
- He **left** for Paris at three o'clock. (complete act of leaving)
- He **left** for Paris as soon as he **heard** the news. (complete act of leaving)
- I looked across at the other table. Pedro **grinned**.
  - Successive events: first looked, then grinned

**Note:** Contrast with Progressive example above: "Pedro was grinning" (already in progress when looked)

---

### 2.2 PAST PERIOD OF TIME

When a speaker relates a situation to a past period of time, the choice of aspect depends on the speaker's communicative purpose in more subtle ways.

---

#### 2.2.1 SIMPLE ASPECT

##### a) Inherently Bounded Situations

Simple aspect is used if completion of an inherently bounded situation at some point during the period referred to is contextually relevant.

**Examples:**
- I **made** a cake this morning so you can bring Christopher in for tea if you like.
  - Relevant: cake-making was completed
  - Result: cake now exists for tea

- He **left** for Paris yesterday afternoon. (complete departure)

---

##### b) Temporally Bounded Situations

Simple aspect is used when what is contextually relevant is:

###### Option 1: The (unanalysed) fact that the situation occurred at all within the period

**Examples:**
- Just imagine! They actually **played** tennis with the Harrisons this morning.
  - Relevant: the surprising fact that it happened at all

- [It is raining. Child asks what to do.]
  - A: But we **played** that yesterday afternoon.
    - Relevant: the activity occurred in that period (not the internal structure)

###### Option 2: The state of affairs at the end point of the activity/period

**Example:**
- I **worked** hard all day yesterday, but I **didn't manage** to finish the report, I'm afraid.
  - Relevant: accumulated work at end of 'yesterday' was still not enough
  - Focus: result at temporal boundary

---

#### 2.2.2 PROGRESSIVE ASPECT

Progressive aspect is used when the speaker's purpose is to:
- **Focus on what activity was going on** at any/all contextually relevant points of time within the period referred to

**Key Points:**
- No distinction between inherently and temporally bounded situations
- Speaker concerned with activity phases before end point is reached
- Whether or when activity was completed/terminated is irrelevant
- (Though this may become clear in wider context)

**Examples:**
- I **was making** a cake this morning and I completely **forgot** to go and pick up the concert tickets.
  - At any point during morning when I might have gone out, I was making cake
  - No reason to suppose making cake was not completed

- I'm sorry, but I **was working** hard all day yesterday and I just **couldn't find** time to type that letter for you.
  - At any time yesterday when I might have typed letter, I was working hard

**Note:** The Progressive may also be used with verbs like **tell, talk about**, etc. to indicate that the situation may not have been completed within the period referred to.

**Example:**
- I **sat** beside John on the bus on my way home. He **was telling** me about his plans for renovating his house.
  - Implication: there may be more to tell

---

### 2.3 THE PRETERITE AND BACKGROUND DESCRIPTION

#### Special Stylistic Use

In the case of individual temporally bounded situations seen as **background situations** within a narrative:
- Situations already obtaining at the point of time to which they are related
- The narrator has, in **formal written style**, a choice of aspect

#### Conversational vs. Formal Style

| Style | Aspect | Function |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Conversational** | Progressive only | Indicates temporary background |
| **Formal/Literary** | Progressive OR Simple | Choice achieves stylistic effects |

#### Simple Aspect Stylistic Effects

Simple aspect may be used to achieve:
1. **Static quality** - no internal development
2. **Characteristic quality** - describes a state

**Example:**
- A middle-aged lady **came** through the swing door as the clock **struck** four – precisely the hour of our appointment. She **was wearing** one of those unmistakable hats... and in her left hand she **carried** a shopping bag bulging at the seams.
  - **was wearing** (Progressive) = temporary, dynamic
  - **carried** (Simple) = static, descriptive, characteristic
  - Creates literary/stylistic variation

**Note:** This choice exists only in the Preterite and only in formal/literary style.

---

### 2.4 FUTURE IN THE PAST

#### Parallel to Present Tense

Section 4 of "The Present Tense" describes the use of Present Progressive to refer to the existence, at the time of speaking, of personal arrangements for future situations.

Similarly, a speaker uses the **Preterite Progressive** to refer to:
- The existence, at a past time, of personal arrangements for situations
- Which, at the past time referred to, lay in the future

**Irrelevant:** Whether or not they are still future in relation to the time of speaking.

**German equivalent:** Uses modal verb (**wollte**)

**Examples:**
- It was five o'clock already. He **was having** some friends in for a meal that evening, so he would have to hurry if he hoped to be ready in time.
  - At 5:00, arrangements existed for future meal
  - From perspective of 5:00, meal was in future

**Simple aspect** may occur with reference to:
- 'Timetable' events
- Other non-personally fixed dates

But only where the context makes it a clear case of **'future in the past'** and not of successive past events.

**Example:**
- He **thought over** his plans for the evening. The concert **started** at eight and he **was picking** Hannah up at her parents' house at half past seven...
  - From perspective of 'thinking over', concert starting at 8 was in the future
  - Simple for timetable future in the past
