2. [[Plosives]]
3. [[Fricatives]]
4. [[Affricates]]
5. [[Lateral and Approximants]]
6. [[Nasals]]

## Vowels vs. Consonants: Two Perspectives

### Phonetic Distinction
- **Consonants**: Obstruction of airstream in the vocal tract
- **Vowels**: No obstruction of airstream in the vocal tract
- **Note**: This is a matter of degree - approximants /w/, /r/, /j/ have hardly any obstruction

### Phonological Distinction  
- **Consonants**: Sounds that typically occur at the margins (onsets and codas) of syllables
- **Vowels**: Sounds that are typically central in a syllable (occurring as the nucleus)

---

## The Syllable Structure

### [[Syllable Components]]
A syllable consists of:
- **[[Onset]]**: Consonant(s) before the nucleus (optional)
- **[[Rhyme]]**: Nucleus + coda
- **[[Nucleus]]**: The central, most sonorous part (usually a vowel) - OBLIGATORY
- **[[Coda]]**: Consonant(s) after the nucleus (optional)

**Example**: /drʌŋk/
- Onset: /dr/
- Nucleus: /ʌ/
- Coda: /ŋk/

---

## English Consonants: Classification System

English consonants are classified by:
1. **Place of articulation** (bilabial, labio-dental, dental, alveolar, post-alveolar, palato-alveolar, palatal, velar, glottal)
2. **Manner of articulation** (plosive, fricative, affricate, nasal, lateral, approximant)  
3. **Intensity of articulation** (fortis vs. lenis)

## Fortis vs. Lenis: The Key Distinction

### [[Fortis Sounds]]
- **Articulation**: More muscular effort and greater breath force
- **Voicing**: Voiceless in all positions
- **Aspiration**: Fortis plosives are aspirated in syllable-initial position
- **Vowel length**: Vowels are shortened before a fortis consonant
- **Examples**: /p/, /t/, /k/, /f/, /θ/, /s/, /ʃ/, /tʃ/

### [[Lenis Sounds]]  
- **Articulation**: Less muscular effort and less breath force
- **Voicing**: May be voiced (but can be devoiced in certain positions)
- **Aspiration**: Unaspirated
- **Vowel length**: Vowels have full length before a final lenis consonant
- **Examples**: /b/, /d/, /g/, /v/, /ð/, /z/, /ʒ/, /dʒ/

## 1. Plosives

### [[Plosive Definition]]
Sounds produced by closing the airstream off completely, then releasing built-up air quickly.

**Three Stages in Plosive Articulation:**
1. **Approach**: Articulators come together and form the closure
2. **Hold**: Air is compressed behind the closure
3. **Release**: Articulators part and compressed air is released rapidly

### English Plosive Inventory

| Place | Fortis | Lenis |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Bilabial | /p/ | /b/ |
| Alveolar | /t/ | /d/ |
| Velar | /k/ | /g/ |

### [[Allophonic Variation in Plosives]]

#### 1. Degrees of Devoicing (Lenis Plosives Only)

**Context Rules for Lenis Devoicing:**
- **Fully voiced**: /v __ v (between voiced sounds) → lobby /lɒbi/
- **Partially devoiced**: /# __ (word-initial) → bus /bʌs/  
- **Fully devoiced**: / __ # (word-final) → cab /kæb/ 

#### German vs. English: Final Devoicing

**[[Auslautverhärtung]]** (Final Devoicing) in German:
- Lenis obstruents become fortis in syllable-final position
- Example: Rad [raːt] (vs. Räder with voiced /d/)
- Los [lɔs] (vs. Lose with voiced /z/)

**Key Difference**: 
- German: devoiced AND fortis (neutralizing contrast)
- English: devoiced but still lenis (contrast preserved)

**Examples preserving contrast in English:**
- bud vs. but
- had vs. hat

#### 2. Degrees of Aspiration (Fortis Plosives Only)

**[[Aspiration]]**: Delay between the release of the plosive and the beginning of vocal fold vibration for the following vowel (shown as h in transcription).

**Context Rules for Aspiration:**
- **Fully aspirated**: /__ ˈV (before stressed vowel) → push, tea, car 
- **Partially aspirated**: /__ .V (before unstressed vowel) → supper, betting
- **Not aspirated**: 
  - /s __ (after /s/) → spin, star, school
  - /__ # (word-final) → cup, beat, rock


### Past Tense Morpheme Pronunciation

The regular past tense/past participle morpheme has three allomorphs:

| Allomorph | Context                         | Example         |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| /ɪd/      | /d,t __ (after /d/ or /t/)      | ended, wanted   |
| /t/       | /FC __ (after fortis consonant) | laughed, kissed |
| /d/       | /~ (elsewhere/lenis)            | sobbed, played  |

### Glottal Stop [ʔ]

**[[Glottal Stop]]**: 
- Not a phoneme in RP or GA
- Serves to reinforce fortis plosives: lap [læʔp]
- In some British accents, replaces /t/ in medial and final positions
  - "a bit of butter" → [ə bɪʔ əv bʌʔə]

**Glottal Onset**: 
- German: much more frequent (before vowels)
- English: mainly reserved for emphasized words
  - "I'm ʔALWAYS angry at Ann"

## 2. Fricatives

### [[Fricative Definition]]
Sounds produced by bringing articulators close together, then pressing air through this narrowing, creating hiss-like friction.

### English Fricative Inventory

| Place | Fortis | Lenis |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Labiodental | /f/ | /v/ |
| Dental | /θ/ | /ð/ |
| Alveolar | /s/ | /z/ |
| Palato-alveolar | /ʃ/ | /ʒ/ |
| Glottal | /h/ | |

---
### Fortis vs. Lenis in Fricatives

| Feature      | Fortis                         | Lenis                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Voicing      | Voiceless in all positions     | May be voiced                   |
| Vowel length | Vowels shortened before fortis | Vowels full length before lenis |


---
### /v/ vs. /w/ Contrast

**German vs. English:**
- German: v, w → both /v/ (Vase, Wind) 
- English: v → /v/ (vase), w → /w/ (wind)

**Common learner errors**:
- German speakers may use /v/ for both or hypercorrectively use /w/

### Plural/Genitive/3rd Person Singular Morpheme

The spelling s for these morphemes has three pronunciations:

| Form | Context                                     | Example              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| /ɪz/ | After /s,z,ʃ,ʒ,tʃ,dʒ __                     | kisses, rises, Jaz's |
| /s/  | After / FC __ (fortis consonant)            | puffs, takes, Pete's |
| /z/  | After / LC, V __ (lenis consonant or vowel) | bars, lives, Ed's    |

**Special case**: house /haʊs/ → houses /haʊzɪz/

### Sound Frequency in RP

**Most frequent consonants**:
1. /n/ (7.6%)
2. /t/ 
3. /d/

**Least frequent consonants**:
1. /tʃ/, 
2. /θ/, 
3. /ʒ/ (0.1%)

**Note on /ʒ/**: Particularly restricted distribution - mainly medial position (usual, pleasure); in initial and final position only in recent French loanwords (genre, beige, garage) with alternative /dʒ/ pronunciations.

### Allophonic Variation in Fricatives

**Lenis Fricatives** follow same devoicing pattern as lenis plosives:
- **Fully voiced**: /v __ v → heavy
- **Partially devoiced**: /# __ → valley 
- **Fully devoiced**: /__ # → leave 

**Beware of Auslautverhärtung!**
- lose /luːz/ → (devoiced but not fortis)
- NOT homophonous with loose /luːs/

### Fricative /h/

**Characteristics**:
- No cross-section diagram: articulators always in place for following vowel
- Narrowing/friction at glottis and throughout vocal tract
- Can only occur at syllable onset

**[[H-dropping]]**: Some British and Australian accents have no phoneme /h/

---

## 3. Affricates

### [[Affricate Definition]]
Combination of plosive + fricative produced with a single articulatory gesture:
- Approach and hold like a plosive
- Release with friction like a fricative

### English Affricates
- **Fortis**: /tʃ/ (chin, choose)
- **Lenis**: /dʒ/ (gin, magic)

### Allophonic Variation in Affricates

Lenis affricate follows same devoicing pattern:
- **Fully voiced**: /v __ v → magic 
- **Partially devoiced**: /# __ → German 
- **Fully devoiced**: /__ # → luggage 

### Spelling Patterns for Affricates

**For /tʃ/**:
- ch → choose, church
- tch → watch, match
- ti → question, mention
- tu → nature, picture
- Others: righteous, cello, Chicago (note: /ʃ/)

**For /dʒ/**:
- j → jam, justice
- g → magic, German, gin
- gg → suggest, exaggerate
- dj → adjective
- dg → edge, bridge
- Others: soldier, arduous

**Note**: Chicago is pronounced with /ʃ/, not /tʃ/

---

## 4. Lateral /l/

### [[Lateral Definition]]
Lateral articulation: air passes around sides of tongue (vs. central articulation where air flows down center)

### Allophonic Variation in /l/

#### Resonance Allophones in RP:

**[[Clear L]] [l]**:
- Context: /__ V, j (before vowels and /j/)
- Examples: land, billion, will you

**[[Dark L]] [ɫ]** (velarized):
- Context: /__ C, # (before consonants and word-finally)  
- Examples: silk, ball

#### Allophonic variation lateral /l/:

**[[Devoiced L]]**:
- /p,t,k __ ˈV (after fortis plosives, before stressed vowel) —> play, Atlantic, clay
- Exception: not in sp__, st__, sk__ clusters

**[[Voiced L]]**: 
- /__ ~ (normally voiced unless above) —> silk, splash

#### Modern Developments

**[[L-vocalization]]**: Word-final dark [ɫ] often vocalized (turned into vowel) by younger speakers in South-East England:
- people [piːpʊ] 
- bottle [bɒʔʊ]

**[[Syllabic L]]**: Word-final /l/ can be syllabic (function as nucleus):
- table /teɪ-bl̩/ 

---

## 5. Approximants /w/, /r/, /j/

### [[Approximant Definition]]
Sounds produced with only an approximated narrowing of the vocal tract (no audible friction).

### Phonological Function

Though phonetically similar to vowels (little obstruction), approximants function as consonants:
1. **Article pronunciation**: "a room" not "*an room"
2. **Syllable function**: occur in onset/coda positions only, never as nucleus

### Approximant /r/

- /r/    / __ V (if before a vowel) —> starring
- /r/    / __ # V (if before a vowel, even if word boundary in between) —> star and (=linking r)
- Ø    / __ C, # (not pronounced if before C or at end word) —> star, start

**Distribution**: /r/ only occurs before vowels in RP (it is non-rhotic)
! BUT Irish, Scottish and Birmingham are rhotic (r-full) accents

### Linking /r/ and Intrusive /r/

**[[Linking /r/]]**: only non-rhotic: r (which is present in spelling) only pronounced if following word begins with vowel (—> far off, near it, …)

**[[Intusive /r/]]**: mainly non-rhotic: /r/ inserted before word beginning with vowel, although no r present in spelling
- esp. after schwa endings: Russia/r/ and China, idea/r/ of it
- less freq. after final /ɑː, ɔː /: I saw/r/ it

### Approximant /j/: Yod-Dropping Before /uː/

![[Pasted image 20260105111106.png]]

### Allophonic Variation

- devoiced / p, t, k __ ˈV (after p, t, k with unstressed V following) —> proud
  (except: sp, st, sk __ ˈV —> spring)
- voiced / __  ̃ (normally voiced unless above) —> road 

---

## 6. Nasals

produced by closing vocal tract and releasing air through nose instead
- opening of passage into the nasal cavity required
- velum is lowered to provide this passage (=no velic closure)

### English Nasal Inventory
- /m/ (bilabial) - mouth
- /n/ (alveolar) - nose  
- /ŋ/ (velar) - wing

### Pronouncing ng

1. words that don’t derive from other word have /ŋg/ word-medially
- e.g. anger —> /æŋgə/, finger —> /fɪŋgə/, single —> /sɪŋgl/, England —> /ɪŋglənd/
1. words that end in /ŋ/ produce derivations and inflectional variants that are spoken with /ŋ/ word-medially
- e.g. sing (/sɪŋ/) —> singer (/sɪŋə/), singing (/sɪŋɪŋ/), sings (/sɪŋz/)
1. exception to rule 2 are derivations with comparative and superlative suffixes -er and -est, here /ŋg/ is spoken
- e.g. longer (/lɒŋgə/), longest (/lɒŋgəst/), stronger (/strɒŋgə/), strongest (/strɒŋgəst/)

## Revision Questions

### Transcription Practice: Past Tense Forms
1. looked → /lʊkt/
2. decided → /dɪsaɪdɪd/  
3. kissed → /kɪst/
4. allowed → /əlaʊd/
5. hummed → /hʌmd/
6. dreamt → /dremt/

### True or False:
1. "English plosives are aspirated in all positions." → **FALSE** (only fortis plosives, and only in specific contexts)
2. "The phoneme /tʃ/ is an affricate." → **TRUE**
3. "Dark [ɫ] occurs before vowels in RP." → **FALSE** (clear [l] before vowels, dark [ɫ] before consonants/word-finally)
4. "German has Auslautverhärtung, English does not." → **TRUE** (English has final devoicing but not fortition)
5. "The plural morpheme is always pronounced /z/." → **FALSE** (three allomorphs: /ɪz/, /s/, /z/)
