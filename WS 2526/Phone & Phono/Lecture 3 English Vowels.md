# Lecture 3: English Vowels

## Semester Outline Reference  
This lecture covers **English vowels** in detail, including classification, monophthongs, and diphthongs. Builds on [[Lecture I: Introduction to Phonetics and English Phonology]] and [[Lecture II: English Consonants]].

## English Vowels: Outline

1. [[Classification of vowels]]
2. [[English monophthongs]]
3. [[English diphthongs]]

---

## Phonetic Classification of Vowels (Universal)

All languages classify vowels by these phonetic criteria:

### 1. [[Tongue Shape]]
- **Openness/Closeness**: How close is the tongue to the palate?
- **Frontness/Backness**: Which part of the tongue is highest?

### 2. [[Lip Shape]]
- Rounded vs. unrounded lips

### 3. [[Constancy of Tongue/Lip Shape]]
- Monophthongs vs. diphthongs (dynamic, shift in tongue position)

### 4. [[Duration]]
- Long vs. short vowels

---

## Vowel Chart

### [[Extreme Vowel Positions]]
The vowel space is defined by four extreme positions:

- **[i]**: Extremely front and close (high front unrounded)
- **[u]**: Extremely back and close (high back rounded)  
- **[a]**: Extremely front and open (low front unrounded)
- **[ɑ]**: Extremely back and open (low back unrounded)

## Classification of English Vowels

### Distinctive Features for English Vowels

English vowels are described by:

1. **[[Constancy of tongue shape]]**: monophthongs vs. diphthongs
2. **[[Tongue shape]]**:
   - Tongue height (closeness/openness): close, half-close, half-open, open
   - Part of tongue highest (frontness/backness): front, central, back
   
![[Pasted image 20260105113146.png]]

### [[Monophthongs vs. Diphthongs]]

**[[Monophthongs]]** (Steady-state vowels):
- Tongue position remains relatively constant
- Simple vowels with no glide
- Examples: /iː/, /ɪ/, /e/, /æ/, /ɑː/, /ɒ/, /ɔː/, /ʊ/, /uː/, /ʌ/, /ɜː/, /ə/

**[[Diphthongs]]** (Vowel glides):
- Dynamic vowels that glide from one position to another
- Have a start point and end point
- Examples: /aɪ/, /eɪ/, /ɔɪ/, /aʊ/, /əʊ/, /ɪə/, /eə/, /ʊə/

## Duration of English Vowels

### [[Vowel Length]] in English

**Key Point**: Vowel length/duration is **NOT a distinctive feature** for English vowels.

However, **quantity (duration) and quality are correlated** - long vowels tend to be different in quality from short vowels.

### [[Allophonic Quantity Rules]] for English Vowels

#### Allophonic Shortening
**Rule**: Stressed vowels are allophonically shortened before fortis consonants 
ˈV: /__ FC
- Examples: feet /fiːt/ , leaf /liːf/ 

#### Allophonic Lengthening  
**Rule**: Stressed vowels are allophonically lengthened before lenis consonants
ˈV: / __ LC
- Examples: feed /fiːd/, leave /liːv/

## English Diphthongs

### [[Closing Diphthongs]]
second element is closer than first

| Diphthong |                   | Direction |
| --------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| /aɪ/      | price, my, file   | Fronting  |
| /eɪ/      | face, day, fail   | Fronting  |
| /ɔɪ/      | choice, boy, foil | Fronting  |
| /aʊ/      | house, now, foul  | Backing   |
| /əʊ/      | goat, go, foal    | Backing   |

### [[Centring Diphthongs]]
Three diphthongs with schwa as second element:

| Diphthong | Example Words |
|-----------|---------------|
| /ɪə/ | sheer, beard, idea, ear, tear (n.) |
| /eə/ | share, Mary, bear, care, pear |
| /ʊə/ | sure, poor, tour, cure |

## Monophthongization Phenomena

### RP Monophthongization of Diphthongs

| Original | Result | Homophones |
|----------|--------|------------|
| /eə/ | /ɜː/ | - |
| /ʊə/ | /ɔː/ | sure - shore |

### RP Monophthongization of Triphthongs

| Word | Triphthong | → Diphthong | → Monophthong | Homophones |
|------|------------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| fire | /aɪə/ | /aːə/ | /ɑː/ | fire - far |
| player | /eɪə/ | /eːə/ | /eː/ | layer - lair |
| sour | /aʊə/ | /aːə/ | /ɑː/ | our - are |
| lower | /əʊə/ | (/ɜːə/) | /ɜː/ | slower - slur |

## Study Essentials Summary

### Part III: Key Concepts

- **Vowel classification**: vowel chart (tongue shape, lip shape, constancy)
- **Allophones of length**: shortening before fortis, lengthening before lenis
- **Distinctive features**: 
  1. Monophthongs vs. diphthongs
  2. Front-central-back
  3. Close, half-close, half-open, open
- **12 (RP) / 11 (GA) monophthongs**: classification by position in vowel chart
- **8 (RP) / 5 (GA) diphthongs**: closing vs. centring; fronting vs. backing
- **RP-GA differences**: inventory (/ɒ/, centring diphthongs), quality (/ɑː/, /əʊ/-/oʊ/), monophthongization
- **English-German differences**: especially /æ/ (too close) and /ɜː/ (rounded)

## Revision Questions

### Question 1: Name the distinctive features used to describe English vowels.
**Answer**: 
1. Constancy of tongue shape (monophthongs vs. diphthongs)
2. Tongue shape (height: close/half-close/half-open/open; backness: front/central/back)
3. Lip shape (rounded vs. unrounded - though not distinctive in English)

### Question 2: Draw /ʊ/ and /ɪ/ in a vowel chart. What features do they share/differ in?

```
      front            central            back
close  • /ɪ/                            • /ʊ/
       |                                  |
       |                                  |
half-c |                                  |
       |                                  |
half-o |                                  |
       |                                  |
open   |                                  |
```

**Shared**: Both are high/close vowels
**Differ**: /ɪ/ is front-central, /ʊ/ is back-central; /ɪ/ is unrounded, /ʊ/ is rounded

### Question 3: In what ways is /ə/ special?
**Answer**:
- **Distribution**: Only occurs in unstressed syllables
- **Frequency**: Most frequent of all phonemes in English
- **Function**: Central to English rhythm and stress patterns

### True or False:
1. "Degree of roundedness is not a distinctive feature of English vowels." → **TRUE** (it's phonetic, not phonemic)
2. "There are 3 nasal vowels in English." → **FALSE** (English has no nasal vowel phonemes)
3. "Cardinal vowels must be represented in square brackets, not in slashes." → **TRUE** (they're reference points, not phonemes)
4. "Phonetically, 28 different vowel sounds can be distinguished." → **TRUE** (though English uses fewer phonemically)
5. "The duration of English vowels is affected by their phonetic environment." → **TRUE** (allophonic lengthening/shortening)
