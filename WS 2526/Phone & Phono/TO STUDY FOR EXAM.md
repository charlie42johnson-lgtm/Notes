# Allophonic Variation 
- need just to say if for e.g. 
	- devoiced / partially voiced / fully voiced
	- not aspirated / partially aspirated / fully aspirated
	- clear l / dark l

---
## Allophonic Variation of Voice:

#### Degrees of Voice (Lenis Plosives, Fricatives, Affricates)

**Context Rules for Lenis Devoicing:**
- **Fully voiced**: /v __ v (between voiced sounds) → lobby /lɒbi/
- **Partially devoiced**: /# __ (word-initial) → bus /bʌs/  
- **Devoiced**: / __ # (word-final) → cab /kæb/ 
---
## Allophones of resonance:
#### Clear L l:
- Context: /__ V, j (before vowels and /j/)
- Examples: land, billion, will you
#### Dark L ɫ (velarized):
- Context: /__ C, # (before consonants and word-finally)  
- Examples: silk, ball
---
## Allophones of Voice for /w,r,j/
#### Approximats /w,r,j/
- devoiced / p, t, k __ ˈV (after p, t, k with unstressed V following) —> proud
  (except: sp, st, sk __ ˈV —> spring)
- voiced / __  ̃ (normally voiced unless above) —> road
##### **RP is non-rhotic, GA is rhotic**

---
# Allophonic Variation of Aspiration:
#### Degrees of Aspiration (Fortis Plosives Only)

**[[Aspiration]]**: Delay between the release of the plosive and the beginning of vocal fold vibration for the following vowel (shown as h in transcription).

**Context Rules for Aspiration:**
- **Fully aspirated**: /__ ˈV (before stressed vowel) → push, tea, car 
- **Partially aspirated**: /__ .V (before unstressed vowel) → supper, betting
- **Not aspirated**: 
  - /s __ (after /s/) → spin, star, school
  - /__ # (word-final) → cup, beat, rock

# German Speaker Pronunciation Differences:

##### **Auslautverhärtung** 
(Final Devoicing) in German:
- Lenis obstruents become fortis in syllable-final position
- Example: Rad [raːt] (vs. Räder with voiced /d/)
- Los [lɔs] (vs. Lose with voiced /z/)

**Key Difference**: 
- German: devoiced AND fortis (neutralizing contrast)
- English: devoiced but still lenis (contrast preserved)

**Examples preserving contrast in English:**
- bud vs. but
- had vs. hat

##### **Hypercorrectivity of /w/ and incorrect use of /v/**
**German vs. English:**
- German: v, w → both /v/ (Vase, Wind) 
- English: v → /v/ (vase), w → /w/ (wind)

**Common learner errors**:
- German speakers may use /v/ for both or hypercorrectively use /w/

##### **Pronouncing f e ll sound instead of c a t sound**

# Assimilation
---
### Types of Assimilation

| 1. Assimilation of Place of Articulation                 | 2. Assimilation of Manner of Articulation              | 3. Assimilation of Energy of Articulation | 4. Assimilation of Voice                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Example:** alveolar plosive /t/ → bilabial plosive /p/ | **Example**: alveolar plosive /d/ → alveolar nasal /n/ | **Example**: lenis /z/ → fortis /s/       | **Example**: voiced [r] → voiceless [r]     |
| ten pigs /ten pɪgz/ → /tem pɪgz/                         | good night /gʊd naɪt/ → /gʊnnaɪt/                      | has to /hæz tə/ → /hæstə/                 | proud, trick, crib (devoiced after /p,t,k/) |
### Direction of Assimilation

| Progressive Assimilation:<br>(A → B)           | Regressive Assimilation:<br>(A ← B)                 | Reciprocal Assimilation:<br>(A→←B)                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sound influences following sound               | Sound is influenced by following sound              | Sounds fuse into new sound sharing features with each          |
| **Example**: voiceless [p,t,k] → voiceless [r] | **Example**: alveolar [d] → dental [d] before /θ,ð/ | **Example**: /t/ + /j/ = /tʃ/ (shut your eyes → shutcher eyes) |

# Syllable Structure Analysis
---
- **Onset**: Consonant(s) before nucleus (optional)
- **Nucleus**: Central, most sonorous part (usually vowel) - OBLIGATORY
- **Coda**: Consonant(s) after nucleus (optional)

##### Example of Syllable structure analysis:
"syllable"

three syllables: /sɪ - lə - bl/
/sɪ/ => onset, nucleus
/lə/ => onset, nucleus
/bl/ => onset, nucleus

# Elision
---
### Elision of Consonants
Often simplifies consonant clusters:

| Written     | Natural      | Example       |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| facts       | /fæks/       | /fækts/       |
| clothes     | /kləʊz/      | /kləʊðz/      |
| months      | /mʌns/       | /mʌnθs/       |
| old man     | /əʊl mæn/    | /əʊld mæn/    |
| next please | /neks pliːz/ | /nekst pliːz/ |

### Elision of Syllables
Can occur when syllables are unstressed, especially when elided syllable contains consonant repeated in following syllable:

- library /laɪbrɪ/ (from /laɪbərɪ/)
- particularly /pətɪkəlɪ/ (from /pətɪkjələlɪ/)
- February /febrɪ/ (from /febjʊərɪ/)
- chocolate /tʃɒklɪt/ (from /tʃɒkəlɪt/)

##### **Elision can occur for both individual phonemes and complete syllables**
