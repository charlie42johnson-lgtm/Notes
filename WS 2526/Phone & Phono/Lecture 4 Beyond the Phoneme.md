1. [[Connected Speech]]
2. [[Syllable]]
3. [[Word Stress]]
4. [[Sentence Stress]]
5. [[Intonation]]

## 1. Connected Speech

### Phenomena of Connected Speech

When words are combined in natural speech, they influence each other:

1. **[[Weakening]]**: Reduction of vowels and sometimes elision of sounds
   **Weak Forms**: Systematic weakening that occurs when function words occur in connected speech
2. **[[Linking]] (Liaison)**: Links between sounds or words in connected speech (e.g. linking /r/, intrusive /r/)
3. **[[Assimilation]]**: Sounds become more like neighboring sounds
4. **[[Elision]]**: Omission of sounds in spoken language

---

## Content Words vs. Function Words

### [[Content Words]] (Lexical Words, Full Words, Autosemantic Words)
- Have stateable lexical meaning (largely independent of context)
- Include: nouns, full verbs, adjectives, majority of adverbs
- Constitute majority of words in vocabulary
- have no weakening 

### [[Function Words]] (Form Words, Grammatical Words, Synsemantic Words)  
- Primarily express grammatical relationships
- Include: determiners, pronouns, conjunctions, auxiliary verbs, prepositions
- Only fairly few words, but highly frequent
- have weak forms

---

## Strong and Weak Forms

### [[Weak Forms]] Definition
- in connected speech function words mostly occur in their weak forms, not strong
- weak forms typically have reduction of vowel quality to /ə/ or /ɪ/, and sometimes elision of consonants
- many words have more than one weak form

About 50 monosyllabic function words have strong and weak forms:

| Word       | Strong Form | Weak Form(s)     |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| that       | /ðæt/       | /ðət/            |
| she        | /ʃiː/       | /ʃɪ/             |
| from       | /frɒm/      | /frəm/           |
| can (aux.) | /kæn/       | /kən/            |
| and        | /ænd/       | /ənd, ən, nd, n/ |
| are        | /ɑː(r)/     | /ə(r)/           |
| but        | /bʌt/       | /bət/            |
| has (aux.) | /hæz/       | /həz, əz/        |
| he         | /hiː/       | /hɪ, ɪ/          |
| her        | /hɜː(r)/    | /hə(r), ə(r)/    |
| of         | /ɒv/        | /əv, v, ə/       |
| than       | /ðæn/       | /ðən, ðn/        |
| them       | /ðem/       | /ðəm, ðm/        |
| the        | /ðiː/       | /ðə, ði/         |
| to         | /tuː/       | /tə, tu/         |
| was        | /wɒz/       | /wəz/            |
| were       | /wɜː(r)/    | /wə(r)/          |
| would      | /wʊd/       | /wəd, d/         |
| will       | /wɪl/       | /l, əl/          |

### When Function Words Appear in Strong Form

Function words appear in their strong form when:
1. **Stress on function word** (contrast or emphasis):
   - "It was YOU who said it [not me]"
   - "You have to do it, whether you want to or NOT"

2. **Contracted negative auxiliaries**:
   - hasn't, wasn't, don't, can't

3. **Before pause** (at end of clause):
   - "What are you here for?"
   - Exception: pronouns ("You've met her, haven't you?")

### Function Words with Only Strong Forms
- Demonstratives: this, that, those, these
- Wh-interrogatives: where, who, which, how

### Special Notes on Weak Forms

**do, have**: 
- Weak form only for auxiliaries
- Full verbs always strong: "Do you know?" (aux.) vs. "What shall I do?" (full verb)

**that**:
- Weak: conjunction ("I think that...") and relative pronoun ("the table that...")
- Strong: demonstrative ("I don't like that book")

**there**:
- Weak: existential there ("there's a mouse")
- Strong: adverb ("I live there")

**wh-words**:
- Weak: relatives ("the girl who saw me")
- Strong: wh-interrogatives ("Who saw the girl?")

---

## Linking (Liaison)

### [[Linking]] Definition
Producing links between sounds or words in connected speech.

### Linking /r/
- r present in spelling is pronounced if following word begins with a vowel
- No intervening pause
- Examples: far off, answer it, near it, car engine

### [[Intrusive /r/]]
- /r/ inserted before word beginning with vowel, although no r in spelling
- Examples: Russia and China, idea of it, law and order
- Controversial in prescriptive contexts

---

## Assimilation

### [[Assimilation]] Definition
A sound (mostly a consonant) becomes more like, or identical with, a neighboring sound regarding one or more of its distinctive features.

**Example**: ten pigs /ten pɪgz/ → /tem pɪgz/ (bilabial /p/ causes alveolar /n/ to become bilabial /m/)

### Types of Assimilation

#### 1. Assimilation of Place of Articulation
- Most common type in English
- Often affects alveolar consonants
- Examples:
  - statement /steɪtmənt/ → /steɪpmənt/
  - ten pigs /ten pɪgz/ → /tem pɪgz/
  - good boy /gʊd bɔɪ/ → /gʊbbɔɪ/
  - that case /ðæt keɪs/ → /ðækkeɪs/

#### 2. Assimilation of Manner of Articulation
- Example: alveolar plosive /d/ → alveolar nasal /n/
  - good night /gʊd naɪt/ → /gʊnnaɪt/

#### 3. Assimilation of Energy of Articulation
- Example: lenis /z/ → fortis /s/
  - has to /hæz tə/ → /hæstə/

#### 4. Assimilation of Voice
- Example: voiced [r] → voiceless [r]
  - proud, trick, crib (devoiced after /p,t,k/)

### Direction of Assimilation

#### [[Progressive Assimilation]] (A → B)
Sound influences following sound
- Example: voiceless [p,t,k] → voiceless [r]

#### [[Regressive Assimilation]] (A ← B)  
Sound is influenced by following sound (most common)
- Example: alveolar [d] → dental [d] before /θ,ð/

#### [[Reciprocal Assimilation]]
Sounds fuse into new sound sharing features with each
- Example: /t/ + /j/ = /tʃ/ (shut your eyes → shutcher eyes)

### Allophonic vs. Phonemic Variation

#### [[Assimilation with Allophonic Variation]]
- Leads to different allophone being produced
- **Obligatory** and not open to speaker choice
- Example: devoicing of /l/ after /p,t,k/ (play, Atlantic, clay)

#### [[Assimilation with Phonemic Variation]]
- Leads to different phoneme being produced
- Typically **optional** (though some have become obligatory over time)
- Examples: /f/ in "have to", /s/ in "used to"

---

## Elision

### [[Elision]] Definition
Omission of one or more sounds in spoken language.

### Elision of Consonants
Often simplifies consonant clusters:

| Written     | Natural      | Example       |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| facts       | /fæks/       | /fækts/       |
| clothes     | /kləʊz/      | /kləʊðz/      |
| months      | /mʌns/       | /mʌnθs/       |
| old man     | /əʊl mæn/    | /əʊld mæn/    |
| next please | /neks pliːz/ | /nekst pliːz/ |

### Elision of Syllables
Can occur when syllables are unstressed, especially when elided syllable contains consonant repeated in following syllable:

- library /laɪbrɪ/ (from /laɪbərɪ/)
- particularly /pətɪkəlɪ/ (from /pətɪkjələlɪ/)
- February /febrɪ/ (from /febjʊərɪ/)
- chocolate /tʃɒklɪt/ (from /tʃɒkəlɪt/)

---

## 2. The Syllable

### [[Syllable]] Definition and Examples

- **Monosyllabic**: try /traɪ/
- **Disyllabic**: sentence /sen-təns/
- **Trisyllabic**: phonetics /fə-ne-tɪks/
- **Polysyllabic**: suprasegmentals /suː-prə-seg-men-tlz/

### Syllable Structure

**[[Syllable template]]**: (C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C)(C)

- **Onset**: Consonant(s) before nucleus (optional)
- **Nucleus**: Central, most sonorous part (usually vowel) - OBLIGATORY
- **Coda**: Consonant(s) after nucleus (optional)

**Minimal syllable**: nucleus only (single vowel)
- Examples: I /aɪ/, RP are /ɑː/, RP err /ɜː/

**Open syllables**: onset + nucleus (no coda)
- Examples: my /maɪ/, RP bar /bɑː/

**Closed syllables**: nucleus + coda
- Examples: at /æt/, ice /aɪs/

### Maximum Onset Principle

When assigning consonants to syllables in polysyllabic words:
- Make the onset of the next syllable as extensive as possible
- Example: exam /ɪgˈzæm/ (not /ɪˈgzæm/ or /ɪkˈsæm/)

### The Sonority Scale

**[[Sonority]]**: Inherent loudness of a sound; dependent on degree and type of obstruction

**[[Obstruents]]**: Airflow impeded to create noise component
- Fricatives and plosives

**[[Sonorants]]**: Airflow not impeded to create noise  
- Voiced nasals, approximants, and vowels

**Sonority Hierarchy** (from most to least sonorous):

1. Vowels (most sonorous)
2. Glides (/j/, /w/)
3. Liquids (/r/, /l/)  
4. Nasals (/m/, /n/, /ŋ/)
5. Fricatives (/s/, /z/, /f/, /v/, etc.)
6. Plosives (/p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, etc.) (least sonorous)

**Syllable principle**: Nucleus has highest sonority; sonority rises to nucleus and falls away from it.

### Syllabic Consonants

**[[Syllabic consonant]]**: Consonant that functions as nucleus of a syllable

**Which consonants can be syllabic?**
- /n/, /l/ (most frequent)
- /m/, /ŋ/ (less frequent)
- /r/ (in GA)

**Diacritic**: [n̩], [l̩], [m̩], [ŋ̩]

**Examples**:

| Slow Speech | Normal Speech |
|-------------|---------------|
| student /ˈstjuːdənt/ | /ˈstjuːdn̩t/ |
| table /ˈteɪbəl/ | /ˈteɪbl̩/ |
| rhythm /ˈrɪðəm/ | /ˈrɪðm̩/ |
| button /ˈbʌtən/ | /ˈbʌtn̩/ |

**Restrictions**: /ən/ cannot be [n̩] after nasals or nasal+plosive clusters:
- cannon, German (OK)
- London, Washington (not [n̩])

### Phonotactics

**[[Phonotactics]]**: Rules of possible phoneme combinations in a language

**Examples of impossible English syllables**:
- */ŋɪbɪ/ (no onset /ŋ/)
- */plæm/ (possible)

#### Constraints on English Syllable Structure

1. **/ŋ/ never occurs in onsets**
2. **/h, j, w/ never occur in codas**
3. **/r/ never occurs in codas in non-rhotic varieties** (RP)
4. **Lenis fricatives /v, ð, z, ʒ/ never occur in onset clusters**
5. **In three-element onset clusters, initial consonant is always /s/**
6. **/t, d, θ/ never combine with /l/ in onset clusters**
7. **Nasals never combine with plosives or affricates in onsets**
8. **Nasals and plosives combining in codas are always homorganic** (same place of articulation)

#### Possible Syllable Types in English

| Structure | Example | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| V | I /aɪ/ | vowel only |
| CV | two /tuː/ | consonant-vowel |
| VC | up /ʌp/ | vowel-consonant |
| CVC | cat /kæt/ | consonant-vowel-consonant |
| CVCC | cats /kæts/ | |
| CCV | tree /triː/ | |
| CCVC | trees /triːz/ | |
| CCVCC | treats /triːts/ | |
| CCCVCCC | strands /strændz/ | |
| CCVCCCC | glimpsed /glɪmpst/ | |

## 3. Word Stress

### [[Stress]] Indication
- Primary stress: ˈ (before stressed syllable)
- Secondary stress: ˌ (before stressed syllable)

Examples:
- today /təˈdeɪ/
- explanation /ˌekspləˈneɪʃn̩/

### Variables Contributing to Stress

Four variables create the perception of stress:

1. **[[Intensity]]**: Greater breath effort and muscular energy; perceived as greater loudness

2. **[[Pitch variation]]**: Higher pitch means stronger stress; pitch = tone height (Tonhöhe)

3. **[[Vowel quality]]**: Unstressed syllables often have vowel reduction to /ə/ or /ɪ, ʊ/

4. **[[Vowel duration]]**: English vowels are shorter in unstressed than in stressed syllables

### Lexically Designated Stress

English has unpredictable stress placement (unlike some languages like French or Polish):

- Monday /ˈmʌn-deɪ/ (stress on 1st syllable)
- prefer /prɪˈfɜːr/ (stress on 2nd syllable)

### Common Stress Patterns

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| ˈ1-2 | wonderful, famous |
| 1-ˈ2 | prefer, energy |
| ˈ1-2-3 | suspicious, phonology |
| 1-ˈ2-3 | engineer, methodical |
| ˌ1-2-ˈ3 | personally, ascertain |
| ˈ1-2-3-4 | Protestantism |
| 1-ˈ2-3-4 | Catholicism |
| ˌ1-2-ˈ3-4 | possibility |
| ˌ1-2-3-ˈ4 | characteristic |
| ˌ1-2-ˈ3-4-5 | transformationally |
| ˌ1-2-3-4-ˈ5 | characterization |
| 1-ˌ2-3-ˈ4-5 | inferiority |

### Suffixes and Stress

#### Suffixes that Attract Primary Stress:
-ade (nouns): parade
-ain (verbs): abstain  
-ee (nouns): addressee
-eer (nouns): engineer
-esque (adj., nouns): grotesque
-ess (verbs): assess
-ique (nouns): critique
-self/-selves: herself

#### Suffixes that Attract Stress on Preceding Syllable:
-ative: alternative
-cient: ancient  
-eous: outrageous
-ial: superficial
-ical: radical
-inal: criminal
-itude: multitude
-ive: attentive
-uous: conspicuous
-itive: positive
-ciency: deficiency
-ety: propriety
-ic: melancholic
-ident: accident
-ion: occasion
-ity: incredulity
-ual: perpetual
-wards: outwards

### RP vs. GA Stress Differences

#### Suffix -ary, -ory:

| Context | RP | GA |
|---------|----|----|
| ˈS __ | /(ə)rɪ/ | /eri, ɔːri/ |
| .S __ | /(ə)rɪ/ | /eri, ɔːri/ |
| Example | satisfactory | territory, temporary |

**Pattern**: ˈ1-2-ˌ3-4 exists in GA but not RP

#### Other Stress Differences

| Word | RP | GA |
|------|----|----|
| address | əˈdres | ˈædres |
| ballet | ˈbæleɪ | bæˈleɪ |
| cafe* | ˈkæfeɪ | kæˈfeɪ |
| cigarette | ˌsɪgəˈret | ˈsɪgəret |
| controversy* | kənˈtrɒvəsi | ˈkɑːntrəvɜːsi |
| frontier* | ˈfrʌntɪə | frʌnˈtɪər |
| garage* | ˈgærɑːʒ | gəˈrɑːʒ |
| inquiry | ɪnˈkwaɪəri | ˈɪŋkwəri |
| laboratory | ləˈbɒrətri | ˈlæbrətɔːri |
| magazine | ˌmægəˈziːn | ˈmægəziːn |
| moustache/mustache | məˈstɑːʃ | ˈmʌstæʃ |
| research* | rɪˈsɜːtʃ | ˈriːsɜːrtʃ |
| translate* | trænsˈleɪt | ˈtrænzleɪt |
| weekend* | ˌwiːkˈend | ˈwiːkend |

*Semi-systematic differences:
- Words ending in -ate: GA often 1st syllable stress, RP 2nd syllable (donate, migrate, vacate, vibrate)
- -ony suffix: secondary stress 2nd from end (testimony, ceremony)
- GA secondary stress on last element of compounds with -berry (blueberry, raspberry)
- -ile endings: reduced vowel in GA, not BrE (fertile, fragile, hostile)

### Word Stress in Compounds

**Initial element stress**:
- ˈpaperback
- ˈorange juice
- ˈsafety belt

**Double stress**:
- ˌpaper ˈbag
- ˌupper-ˈclass

**Compound place-names** (usually double stress):
- ˌNotting ˈHill
- ˌNew ˈYork
- ˌSilicon ˈValley
- ˌTrafalgar ˈSquare
- ˌFifth ˈAvenue
- ˌPaddington ˈStation
- ˌPiccadilly ˈCircus
- ˌHyde ˈPark
- ˌPark ˈRoad
- ˌPark ˈDrive

**Exception**: road names ending in Street → ˈPark Street

**German vs. English compound stress**:
- German: ˈBuckingham Paˌlast
- English: ˌBuckingham ˈPalace

### [[Stress Shift]]

Stress can shift when suffixes are added:

| Base Word | Derived Word |
|-----------|--------------|
| ˈmethod | məˈthodical |
| ˈcertain | ˌasˈcertain |
| ˈpolitics | pəˈlitical |
| pəˈlitical | ˌpoliˈtician |

### [[Contrastive Stress]]

When two words have identical segments but different stress patterns:

| Word | Stress | Category |
|------|--------|----------|
| inˈcrease | verb | /ɪnˈkriːs/ |
| ˈincrease | noun | /ˈɪŋkriːs/ |

Other examples: 
- ˈpermit (noun) vs. perˈmit (verb)
- ˈrecord (noun) vs. reˈcord (verb)
- ˈobject (noun) vs. obˈject (verb)
- ˈpresent (noun/adjective) vs. preˈsent (verb)

---

## 4. Sentence Stress

### [[Sentence Stress]] Principles

In connected speech, function words tend to receive **no stress**:

**Example**: I've heard that Jack and Jane spent their holidays in Jamaica.
→ Unstressed function words: I've, that, and, their, in

### Exceptions to Unstressed Function Words

Function words **DO** receive stress when:
1. **Speaker wants to emphasize** the function word (for contrast)
2. **Wh-words** functioning as interrogative pronouns (where, why, which)
3. **Demonstratives** (this, that, these, those)

### Rhythm: Stress-Timing vs. Syllable-Timing

**[[Stress-timing]]** (English):
- Stressed syllables occur at roughly regular intervals
- No matter how many unstressed syllables come between
- Example: 'What are the | 'plans for to- |'morr-ow, | 'John?

**[[Syllable-timing]]** (French, Spanish):
- Each syllable takes approximately equal time

---

## 5. Intonation

### [[Intonation]] Definition
Variation of pitch (tone height) over stretches of speech.

**[[Pitch]]**: Result of the frequency (speed of vibration) of the vocal folds

**Tone languages** (Mandarin Chinese, Thai): pitch differences distinguish word meanings

**Intonation languages** (English, German): pitch differences signal grammatical and attitudinal information

### Functions of Intonation

#### 1. [[Grammatical Function]]
Intonation can signal the syntactic role of an utterance:
- Statement vs. question
- Question types (yes/no vs. wh-)

#### 2. [[Focusing Function]]  
Intonation can mark the most important information in an utterance:
- New information typically gets prominence
- Given information is deaccented

#### 3. [[Attitudinal Function]]
Intonation can signal attitudes:
- Enthusiasm, doubt, surprise, anger
- Same words, different intonation = different attitude

**Example**: HAS he?
- HAS he? (rising) = "that's great!" / enthusiastic
- HAS he? (falling) = "who cares?" / dismissive

#### 4. [[Discourse Function]]
Intonation can indicate turn-taking:
- Rising intonation may invite response
- Falling intonation may signal turn completion

### Intonation Structure

#### [[Intonation Group]] (Tone Group)
- Basic unit of intonation
- Often corresponds to grammatical clauses (but not necessarily)
- Consists of:
  - Nucleus (main stress syllable)
  - Optionally unstressed and less stressed syllables before/after

#### [[Nucleus]]
- The last very prominent syllable in the intonation group
- Carries the main pitch movement (nuclear tone)
- Pitch movement either restricted to nucleus or continues to end of tone unit

### Nuclear Tones

| Tone | Symbol | Example | Typical Use |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Fall** | ˋ | WHERE do you LIVE? | Neutral statement/question |
| **Rise** | ˊ | WHERE have you BEEN? | Question, surprise, anger |
| **Fall-Rise** | ˇ | I'll BE there SOON | Reassurance, politeness |
| **Rise-Fall** | ˆ | The FILM was WONderful | Emphatic statement |

### Examples of Intonation Groups

| Example | Analysis |
|---------|----------|
| WHEN? | Single nuclear tone |
| WHEN did you say you would ARRIVE? | Nucleus at end |
| When he finally ARRIVED, he discovered his friends had already LEFT. | Two groups |
| REGRETTABLY, he discovered his friends had already LEFT. | Two groups |
| I don't KNOW. | Single group |
| I DON'T. NO. | Two groups |
| He washed and fed the dog. | Single group |
| He washed and fed the dog. | Two groups (different meaning) |

### New Trends: High-Rising Terminal (HRT)

**[[HRT]]**: Rising tones at the end of an intonation group which is not a question

- Mostly used by younger people, especially women
- Growing in use in all English-speaking countries
- Seems to be used to appear less assertive
- Also called "uptalk" or "Australian Question Intonation"

**Example**: "So I was talking to this guy? And he said he knew you?"

## Revision Questions

### Question 1: Define "nucleus" in phonetics (two meanings)
**Answer**:
1. **Syllable nucleus**: The central, most sonorous part of a syllable (usually a vowel)
2. **Intonation nucleus**: The last very prominent syllable in an intonation group that carries the main pitch movement

### Question 2: Why are vowels different in content (noun) vs. content (adjective)?
**Answer**: Different stress patterns cause different vowel qualities:
- content (noun): /ˈkɒntent/ → stressed first syllable, full vowel /ɒ/
- content (adjective): /kənˈtent/ → stressed second syllable, reduced vowel /ə/ in first syllable

### Question 3: Is syllable elision likely in "historical" in rapid speech?
**Answer**: No, because neither the second (/ɪ/) nor third (/t/) syllable contains a repeated consonant that would facilitate elision, and the stress pattern maintains all syllables.

### Question 4: What phenomenon is /tembɑɪks/ for "ten bikes"?
**Answer**: **Regressive assimilation of place** - alveolar /n/ becomes bilabial /m/ before bilabial /b/.

### True or False:
1. "The maximal syllable in English consists of three consonants in the coda, a vowel, and four consonants in the onset." → **FALSE** (max is 3C onset + V + 5C coda, e.g. glimpsed /glɪmpst/)
2. "/hʌŋk/ is a possible word in English." → **TRUE** (follows phonotactic constraints)
3. "All consonants except approximants are sonorants." → **FALSE** (opposite: approximants ARE sonorants, along with nasals and vowels)
4. "The noun decrease and the verb decrease can be said to have contrastive stress." → **TRUE**
5. "Stress-timing means that stressed syllables occur in roughly equal intervals in a language." → **TRUE**
6. "Function words can receive sentence stress." → **TRUE** (for emphasis, contrast, or when they're wh-words/demonstratives)
7. "High-rising terminals are only used by women." → **FALSE** (mostly, but not exclusively)
8. "English is a tone language, because it uses intonation to change the meaning of an utterance." → **FALSE** (intonation language, not tone language - pitch doesn't distinguish lexical meanings)
