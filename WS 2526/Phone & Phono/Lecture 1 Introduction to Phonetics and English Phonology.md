## Learning to Transcribe: Why?

### The Complex Relationship Between Sound and Spelling in English

English spelling and pronunciation have a notoriously complex relationship. Unlike many other languages with more phonetic spelling systems, English requires learners to master the [[International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]] to accurately represent speech sounds.

#### Key Problems with English Spelling:

1. **Multiple pronunciations for the same letter(s)**
   - The letter a is pronounced differently in various words
   - Example: cat /kæt/, car /kɑː/, cat /keɪ/, father /ɑː/, about /ə/

2. **Multiple spellings for the same sound**
   - The long i-sound /iː/ has at least 9 different spellings:
     - ee in "feel"
     - ea in "fleece"  
     - e in "be"
     - ie in "believe"
     - ei in "receive"
     - y in "city"
     - i in "ski"
     - ey in "key"
     - ae in "Caesar"

3. **Combination of letters representing single sounds**
   - clean → /kliːn/ (ea = single vowel sound)
   - shoot → /ʃuːt/ (oo = single vowel sound)

4. **Single letter representing two sounds**
   - x typically represents /ks/ as in "fix" /fɪks/

5. **Silent letters**
   - climb → /klaɪm/ (b not pronounced)
   - psychology → /saɪˈkɒlədʒi/ (p not pronounced)
   - sword → /sɔːd/ (w not pronounced)
   - knight → /naɪt/ (k and gh not pronounced)
   - wrong → /rɒŋ/ (w not pronounced)

### [[Homographs]]
Words with identical spelling but different pronunciations and meanings:
- **lead** (to guide) /liːd/ vs. **lead** (metal) /led/
- **read** (present) /riːd/ vs. **read** (past) /red/
- **tear** (from eye) /tɪər/ vs. **tear** (to rip) /teər/

### [[Homophones]]  
Words with identical pronunciation but different spellings and meanings:
- **night** /naɪt/ vs. **knight** /naɪt/
- **right** /raɪt/ vs. **write** /raɪt/ vs. **rite** /raɪt/
- **see** /siː/ vs. **sea** /siː/
- **pair** /peər/ vs. **pear** /peər/ vs. **pare** /peər/

### The <-ough> Conundrum
The spelling <-ough> has at least 6 different pronunciations:
1. /oʊ/ as in "though"
2. /uː/ as in "through"  
3. /ɒf/ as in "trough"
4. /ɔː/ as in "thought"
5. /aʊ/ as in "bough"
6. /ʌf/ as in "rough"

## The Phonemes of English

### [[Vowel Phonemes]]

#### [[Monophthongs]] (Simple Vowels)
English has 12 monophthongs (simple vowels) in RP:

| Phoneme | Example Words | Description |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| /ɪ/ | fill, kit, give | front-central, half-close |
| /iː/ | feel, fleece, cream | front, close, long |
| /e/ | fell, dress, ten | front, half-close to half-open |
| /æ/ | cat, trap, back | front, half-open to open |
| /ʌ/ | cut, strut, chuck | central, half-open to open |
| /ɑː/ | cart, father, part | central-back, open, long |
| /ɒ/ | cot, cloth, job | back, open (RP only) |
| /ɔː/ | court, north, force | back, half-open to half-close, long |
| /ʊ/ | full, foot, bush | back-central, half-close |
| /uː/ | fool, goose, rude | back, close, long |
| /ə/ | the, about, afraid | central, half-close to half-open (schwa) |
| /ɜː/ | third, nurse, worm | central, half-close to half-open, long |

#### [[Diphthongs]] (Vowel Glides)
English diphthongs are dynamic vowels that glide from one position to another:

**Closing Diphthongs**:
- /aɪ/ as in "file", "price", "my"
- /eɪ/ as in "fail", "face", "day"  
- /ɔɪ/ as in "foil", "choice", "boy"
- /aʊ/ as in "foul", "house", "now"
- /əʊ/ (RP) or /oʊ/ (GA) as in "foal", "goat", "go"

**Centring Diphthongs**:
- /ɪə/ as in "sheer", "beard", "idea"
- /eə/ as in "share", "Mary", "bear"
- /ʊə/ as in "sure", "poor", "tour"

### [[Consonant Phonemes]]

English has 24 consonant phonemes:

| Place | Fortis | Lenis |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Bilabial** | /p/ pig | /b/ big |
| **Alveolar** | /t/ tart | /d/ dart |
| **Velar** | /k/ curl | /g/ girl |
| **Labiodental** | /f/ file | /v/ vile |
| **Alveolar** | /s/ seal | /z/ zeal |
| **Palato-alveolar** | /ʃ/ pressure | /ʒ/ pleasure |
| **Dental** | /θ/ thigh | /ð/ thy |
| **Affricates** | /tʃ/ chin | /dʒ/ gin |
| **Nasals** | | /m/ mouth, /n/ nose, /ŋ/ wing |
| **Approximants** | | /w/ wail, /r/ rate, /j/ Yale, /l/ late |
| **Glottal** | /h/ hail | |

## Prescriptivism vs. Descriptivism

### [[Descriptivism]]
An approach to language study that attempts to objectively describe language as it is actually used by a given speech community at a given point in time. Descriptivists:
- Document actual usage patterns
- Describe systematic variations without judgment
- Recognize that language change is natural

**Example of descriptive statement:**
"32% of speakers of AmE pronounce 'sorry' with /ɔː/, 68% with /ɑː/" (Wells, Longman Pronunciation Dictionary)

### [[Prescriptivism]]
An approach that attempts to set up rules for "correct" language use, often based on an imagined ideal state rather than actual usage. Prescriptivists:
- Establish norms for "proper" usage
- Often ignore actual language variation
- May be based on historical or social ideals

**Example of prescriptive statement:**
"In many compounds whose second element begins with h, the h is silent unless the accent falls on the syllable that it begins; thus philharmonic should not sound the h" (Fowler's Modern English Usage 1968:484)

---

## Standard Accents

### Key Terms:

**[[Variety]]**: A form of the language (pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary) used by a specific group of speakers (e.g., in a specific region)

**[[Dialect]]**: Grammar and vocabulary used by a specific group of speakers

**[[Accent]]**: Pronunciation used by a specific group of speakers

### Major Varieties of English:
- **BrE** = British English
- **AmE** = American English  
- **NZE** = New Zealand English
- **AusE** = Australian English
- **SAE** = South African English
- **IndE** = Indian English
- **KenE** = Kenyan English

### [[Standard Accents]]

#### RP: Received Pronunciation (British Standard)
- Also called: Queen's English, Oxford English, BBC English
- "Received" = socially accepted
- Non-regional social accent (not tied to a specific geographic region)
- Spoken by about 2-5% of the UK population
- Connotations of "poshness" or upper-class status
- Modern variations: near-RP, Estuary English

#### GA: General American (US Standard)
- Also called: Network Standard, Network English
- Origin: accent of educated speakers of the Midwest
- Spoken by the majority of Americans (those without noticeable Eastern or Southern accents)
- Considered the "neutral" American accent for media

## Phonetics vs. Phonology

### [[Phonetics]]
The study of speech sounds and their concrete characteristics. The term "phone" comes from Greek words for 'sound' and 'voice'. The science of speech sounds.

#### Types of Phonetics:

1. **[[Articulatory Phonetics]]**: Describes how speech sounds are produced
2. **[[Acoustic Phonetics]]**: Describes the physical properties of the speech signal
3. **[[Auditory Phonetics]]**: Studies the perception of speech sounds by the listener

### [[Phonology]]
The study of the sound system of a particular language

---

## Articulatory Phonetics: How Speech Sounds Are Produced

### The Speech Production Mechanism

English uses **egressive airstream** (air moving out from the lungs):

1. **Air source**: Lungs push air out
2. **Air passage**: Air moves through the windpipe/trachea and larynx
3. **Modification**: Movements in the vocal tract modify the airstream to produce speech sounds

### The Larynx and Vocal Folds

The larynx contains the **vocal folds** (formerly called vocal cords) which can be in different states:

#### [[Voiceless Sounds]]
- Glottis is wide open
- Vocal folds are not vibrating
- Air passes through freely
- Examples: /p/, /t/, /k/, /f/, /s/, /θ/

#### [[Voiced Sounds]]
- Glottis is closed (vocal folds are close together)
- Vocal folds are in vibration
- Creates a buzzing sound
- Examples: /b/, /d/, /g/, /v/, /z/, /ð/

#### [[Glottal Stop]] [ʔ]
- Glottis is closed completely
- Vocal folds are not vibrating
- Airflow is blocked momentarily
- Not a phoneme in RP or GA (but occurs in some varieties)
- Used to reinforce fortis plosives in some positions

### The Vocal Tract

![[Pasted image 20260105101856.png]]

#### [[Articulators]]:

**[[Active Articulators]]**: Organs that move and are actively involved in producing sounds
- Lower lip
- Tongue (tip, blade, front, back, root)

**[[Passive Articulators]]**: Targets of articulation (either through direct contact or approximation)
- Upper lip
- Teeth
- Alveolar ridge (ridge behind upper teeth)
- Hard palate (roof of mouth)
- Soft palate/velum (movable back part of palate)
- Uvula (hanging tip of soft palate)

---

## Classification of Speech Sounds

### 1. [[Manner of Articulation]]
- **Consonants**: Obstruction of airstream in the vocal tract
- **Vowels**: No obstruction of airstream in the vocal tract
- Note: This is a matter of degree (approximants have very little obstruction)

### 2. [[Place of Articulation]]
- **Consonants**: Place of contact or maximal approximation
- **Vowels**: Highest point of tongue arch

### 3. [[Intensity of Articulation]]
- **Fortis**: High muscular tension, strong breath force (voiceless sounds)
- **Lenis**: Little muscular tension, weak breath force (may be voiced)

### 4. [[Voicedness vs. Voicelessness]]
- **Voiceless sounds**: Vocal folds open (no vibration)
- **Voiced sounds**: Vocal folds vibrating

---

## Places of Articulation

![[Pasted image 20260105102325.png]]

---

## Manner of Articulation

### [[Plosives]] (Stops)
Complete closure of airstream, then quick release
- English: /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/

### [[Fricatives]]
Articulators brought close together, air pressed through narrowing creating hiss-like friction
- English: /f/, /v/, /θ/, /ð/, /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /h/

### [[Affricates]]
Combination of plosive + fricative
- English: /tʃ/ (chin), /dʒ/ (gin)

### [[Nasals]]
Velum lowered, air passes through nasal cavity
- English: /m/, /n/, /ŋ/

### [[Laterals]]
Air passes around sides of tongue
- English: /l/

### [[Approximants]]
Articulators approach but don't create friction
- English: /w/, /r/, /j/

## Phonology: The Phoneme

### [[Phoneme]] Definition
- Smallest contrastive (distinctive, meaning-distinguishing) unit in the sound system of a language
- "Families of sounds" (D. Jones)
- language-specific
- Abstract units —> realised by phones
- subject of phonology
- Notated with slashes: / /

### [[Phone]] Definition  
- The smallest identifiable unit of speech
- Concrete, real-life sounds as we produce them
- Not specific to a language
- subject of phonetics
- Notated with square brackets: [ ]

![[Pasted image 20260105102521.png]]
### [[Minimal Pair Analysis]]
Method used to establish what phonemes exist in a language:

**[[Minimal pairs]]**: Pairs of words that differ in meaning and in only one sound
- Examples: 
  - beg /beg/ vs. bed /bed/
  - ran /ræn/ vs. pan /pæn/
  - house /haʊs/ vs. hiss /hɪs/
  - write /raɪt/ vs. rhyme /raɪm/

### [[Allophones]]
Variant realizations of the same phoneme that show consistent phonetic differences

#### Types of Allophonic Variation:

**[[Complementary Distribution]]**: Allophones occur in different linguistic contexts (conditioned by environment)
- Example: /l/ in RP
  - Clear [l] in "clear", "long" (before vowels and /j/)
  - Dark [ɫ] in "cold", "call" (before consonants and word-finally)

**[[Free Variation]]**: Allophones can occur in the same linguistic context (speaker choice)
- Example: /r/ in "very" can be realized as approximant [ɹ] or tap [ɾ]

## Distinctive Features of English Consonants

English consonants are described by three distinctive features:

1. **[[Place of Articulation]]**: bilabial, labiodental, dental, alveolar, palato-alveolar, palatal, velar, glottal

2. **[[Manner of Articulation]]**: plosive, fricative, affricate, nasal, lateral, approximant

3. **[[Intensity of Articulation]]**: fortis vs. lenis

**Note**: Type of airstream, voicing, and other articulatory features used for classifying phones in phonetics are NOT distinctive in English.

## Revision Questions

### Question 1: Which three parameters are usually used to describe English consonants?
**Answer**: Place of articulation, manner of articulation, and intensity of articulation (fortis vs. lenis).

### Question 2: Give the places of articulation of the English phonemes /b/, /n/, /l/.
**Answer**:
- /b/: bilabial
- /n/: alveolar  
- /l/: alveolar

### Question 3: Describe the state of the glottis in the articulation of the following sounds: [v], [s], [ʔ].
**Answer**:
- [v]: voiced (vocal folds vibrating)
- [s]: voiceless (vocal folds open, not vibrating)
- [ʔ]: glottal stop (vocal folds closed, not vibrating)

### Phonetics vs. Phonology Identification:
1. "/t/ is an alveolar plosive in English." → **Phonology** (describes a phoneme in the system)
2. "[f] is a labiodental fricative." → **Phonetics** (describes a concrete phone)
3. "/f/ is a labiodental fricative." → **Phonology** (describes a phoneme)
4. "English has 24 consonants." → **Phonology** (describes the phoneme inventory)

### True or False:
1. "Homophones are words that are spelled alike but pronounced differently." → **FALSE** (homophones sound the same, homographs are spelled the same)
2. "One of the diphthongs occurring in GA is /oʊ/." → **TRUE** (GA has /oʊ/ corresponding to RP /əʊ/)
3. "The phoneme /ɒ/ occurs only in GA but not in RP." → **FALSE** (/ɒ/ occurs in RP but NOT in GA)
4. "Minimal pairs are pairs of words that differ in meaning and in only one sound." → **TRUE**
5. "The glottal stop is a phoneme in both RP and GA." → **FALSE** (glottal stop is not a phoneme in RP or GA, though it occurs)
